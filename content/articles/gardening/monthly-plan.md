## July 2024

- **Select the Plot**
    - I chose a 10x14 full-sun patch of lawn next to the back porch. I deployed a heavy tarp to begin smothering the grass.
    - HOA architectural review committee approved the change
- **Soil Testing:**
    - Take soil samples and send them for analysis to understand nutrient levels and pH.
    - Review results to determine any necessary amendments.

I ordered some heirloom seeds from Missouri ([rareseeds.com](https://www.rareseeds.com/)).

    - Finalize vegetables to grow and their planting schedule.
    - Start acquiring cool-season plants: peas, garlic, etc.

- **Clearing the Grass:**
    - Add a layer of compost or mulch to begin enriching the soil.

    - Begin adding organic soil amendments based on soil test results (e.g., lime to adjust pH, compost for nutrients).

- **Maintaining Cool-Season Crops:**
    - Water regularly and ensure proper spacing for optimal growth.
    - Mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

## November 2024

- **Composting:**
    - Continue adding compost to the plot to improve soil structure and fertility.
    - Turn the soil gently if needed to incorporate organic material.
