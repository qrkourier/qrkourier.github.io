*Note on the Relationship to the Author:*
This narrative appears to be a piece of fiction or a creative writing exercise authored by Iris Jean Yandle Beatty. While the protagonist shares the first name of Iris's mother (Minnie), the life events described—being orphaned at age four, having multiple husbands, and having no surviving children—contradict the actual biography of Iris's mother, Minnie Parks Yandle, as detailed in Iris's memoirs. Minnie Brantley is a character created by the author, perhaps exploring themes of resilience, loss, and new beginnings that mirrored her own family's values.

## Part I: The Ending

For this significant day, fair skies with high cumulous clouds had blessed the countryside, offering slowly moving areas of shade for the house and the wide yard that was shaded with ten huge oaks, most of them planted a hundred years ago. Toward evening, the breeze that had offered its cooling efforts diminished; however, a brilliant sunset colored the western horizon, as if even the heavens were offering a special finale for this day.

Minnie, a middle-aged but sturdy woman, watched her last guest leave, and at last sat down in the swing at the end of the porch, where she could see the western sky as the sunset faded and the daylight dimmed to dusk. The house, almost enwrapped by the great oak trees, was painted white, with screened porches on three sides. Minnie had lived here for twelve years, and she had always enjoyed the wide yards and the big trees. Now she sat alone and quietly in the gently moving swing. It had been a demanding day.

It was the day of Elmer Brantley's funeral. Elmer was Minnie's husband of nearly fifteen years, the fourth generation of his family to farm the land in Parker's Valley. He had died after a grueling illness during which Minnie served as his nurse and the sole manager of the farm.

Minnie felt a large sadness at having to leave this house. When she had moved in, she thought she would probably live here for the rest of her life—but she had thought that before. Disappointment had come this time with the same shock and helpless grief she had endured so many times before. She had worked hard to improve the farm and keep it ready for the next generation of Elmer’s family to take it over. But Elmer’s surviving children—three daughters who married military men and moved away, and one son, Clyde—did not want to keep the farm. They want to sell the land and divide the proceeds.

### The Trouble with Clyde

The most immediate threat was Elmer's son, Clyde. Unlike his father, Clyde was irresponsible and struggled with alcoholism. He had lost his own property and failed to support his wife and five children. Elmer had planned to leave the farm to his only living son, but it had become abundantly clear that Clyde could not handle the farm without losing it or ruining it.

On the night of the funeral, after the guests had left, the silence was shattered. Minnie’s best friends and neighbors, Ardie and Gary, were still with her when they saw headlights turn into the drive.

"I think it’s Clyde, headed this way," Gary said. "I saw his truck turn out of his driveway just after I passed it. He couldn’t keep up with me, but he was driving this direction."

Clyde’s truck, with one headlight aiming askew, roared up the driveway. He failed to slow appropriately and hit one of the oak trees before coming to a stop. He was staggering drunk. He crawled out of the truck and stumbled onto the porch, yelling for Minnie, pounding on the door until he ripped the screen.

Minnie stood in the hall, watching through the window as Clyde tried to force the door with a ring of keys that hadn't worked in fifteen years. When that failed, he began to kick the door, screaming in rage.

"I will not live in danger of being attacked or even have my peace disturbed by a drunk every time he takes a notion to call on me," Minnie declared. She called the Sheriff.

When the deputy arrived, Clyde was cuffed and placed in the backseat of the patrol car. Minnie made the difficult decision to press charges, hoping that jail time and forced rehabilitation might save his life, even if she cannot save his inheritance. She promised to help his wife and children, but she would not hand the farm over to be squandered.

## Part II: A History of Loss

Minnie's resilience was born of a lifetime of tragedy. As she sat on the porch that night, she reflected on her history of "new beginnings," almost all of which were forced upon her by loss.

She had been orphaned at the age of four. Her parents, a wealthy young couple, died in a car accident while she was staying with a temporary babysitter. Due to a miscommunication, authorities did not know where she was. She spent nearly a year living in poverty with the babysitter's relative, an eccentric elderly woman named "Aunt Hattie."

Aunt Hattie lived in a primitive farmhouse without electricity or running water. It was there that Minnie learned to work hard. She went barefoot, wore shirts over her short dresses, and learned to milk cows, chop kindling, and gather eggs. She learned that "they will come when they want to come," a phrase Aunt Hattie used to dismiss her questions about her parents.

She was finally located by her parents' estate lawyers only by accident, when a searcher stumbled upon the connection. Minnie was taken away from the only stability she had found since her parents' death, moving through a series of guardians and caretakers until she came of age.

Adulthood brought its own sorrows—the loss of three husbands and her own children. She learned that "new beginnings" were a skill she had to master to survive. And now, she was facing another one.

## Part III: The Departure

Determined not to watch Elmer’s farm fall into ruin or be sold to strangers while she was present, Minnie executed a meticulous plan to close down her life there. She gave herself two full months to make preparations.

She spent months harvesting the final crops and selling off the beef cattle and pigs. She found homes for the barn cats and cleaned the barns and chicken coops until they were spotless. She packed only her personal belongings and the furniture she bought herself, leaving the rest for Elmer's daughters to claim or sell.

Minnie decided to return to a piece of land she inherited from her parents—500 acres she hasn't seen since she was a child. It had been leased to a paper company for timber, but the lease had expired. She hoped the old house was still standing. She wasn't sure if it was habitable, or even if there was a road to it, but it was hers.

## Part IV: The Caravan

In a bold move, Minnie convinced her best friends, Ardie and Gary, to join her. They, too, were ready for a change.

On a Tuesday morning in November, a caravan departed the Brantley farm. Minnie drove a new van pulling a trailer filled with chickens, goats, and pets. Ardie and Gary followed in a moving van, and their sons drove pickup trucks loaded with equipment.

They left behind the sorrow of the past years, heading toward a property Minnie barely remembered, ready to build a new life together from the ground up. It was the sixth—or perhaps seventh—new beginning of Minnie Brantley's life.
