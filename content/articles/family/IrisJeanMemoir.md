## Introduction

I am truly an elderly lady, and at the age of seventy-five I decided to do something a lot of old folks do—think about, and then write about, events my family and I have lived through, with hints of the experiences that were delightful, or those that were harder to manage, or to overcome, or just to live through. Over the seventy-five years of my life there have been sad, glad, terrible, and marvelous, and sometimes even blessed changes in the way all people live, and move, and have their being. When I was born in 1931 the medical community—that is hospitals, doctors, nurses, and makers of medications—had few medicines to offer to patients. There were palliatives, and life-saving surgeries, but not much at all that could truly be called medicines, as we think of them in 2007.

## The Unexpected Arrival

I was born in 1931. I was not the first child in our small family. My sister, Ella Cornelia, was born in November, six full years and a few months earlier than me. In those days different families had different rules about explaining to “innocent” children that a child was on the way. My sister was well into her seventh year. In February of 1931 our mother arranged it with a neighbor to “invite” little Ella Cornelia to her house for a day or so, and it happened just like that. Innocent, and unwarned Ella Cornelia went with Pauline Funderburk to her house for an overnight stay, and was having a lovely time when Pauline told her to get ready to go back home.

My sister had been the only—not just the only, but the ONLY—grandchild in the Yandle family, and in the Park’s family she was the oldest grandchild. She had been the star of the show for six, going a couple of months into the seventh year, being the star of the show with aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, and friends. She in no way expected even the slightest competition.

Ella Cornelia walked confidently into her own house, and didn’t at all understand why her mother was sitting down holding a little baby girl, with several neighbors sitting around the room, all of them paying no attention to Ella Cornelia, who was the only child in the family, and instead watching her as she beheld the fact—and it seemed to be a fact—that Mother was holding a little baby. Since I was so young I can’t offer a quote of just how I was introduced to my sister, but I heard several reports of what my sister squalled out when she actually understood that she had a baby sister. Her first, and for a long time her only unrequited wish was: “Take her back!!!”

Ella Cornelia (named for Grandmother Ella Yandle, and Grandmother Cornelia Parks so that she was accustomed to hearing her entire name as neither grandmother could be slighted just to shorten her name) was angry that her parents would actually “buy” another baby without at least warning her. She—at seven years old and happy as an only child—most definitely didn’t want a new sister who would share her very satisfactory world. It took about ten or eleven years for my sister to come to grips with the fact that Mother and Daddy were not going to “return” me to where I came from.

## Sister's Illness

It didn’t help my sister at all that when I was two, or close to three years old, she became seriously ill. Those were days, nearly fifteen years away from penicillin, when there were no sure medications. Medicine, in those days, was mostly helpful in surgeries, injuries, and the birth of children.

The year was 1933 or 1934. Our mother blamed the illness on intense exertion when playing games with schoolmates. In those days when there was no television, and few radios, children actually went out into the yard and played together. One day the teacher of my sister’s class handed her female students a long jump rope, and they went outside to play during recess.

My sister was a determined person, and she was a pretty good athlete. On that particular day my sister’s group became the jumpers. All of her team-mates touched the rope, however, she was the last surviving jumper in her group. The rules were, that when only one member of a team was still jumping, she could restore her group as jumpers instead of their becoming the rope turners if—and it was a big if—the last jumper still jumping in the game could successfully jump ten turns of the rope alone without touching the rope.

My sister jumped ten turns of the rope by herself, and won another chance for her team. Her team rejoined her, and the game continued. Her team jumped rope for ten games. She had no rest, and she jumped every turn of the rope until she was the only jumper left, then she jumped ten times without touching the rope and won the return of all of her team mates. Ella Cornelia was very proud of herself that day.

That night she developed a fever. It turned into pleurisy and heart trouble. Because her illness was both quick and deadly, at least five doctors at Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina, examined her. Four of those doctors said that in their opinion there was no hope of her recovery, and it would be better to keep Ella Cornelia as comfortable as possible until she died, because she would never again be really well and healthy.

Dear, dependable Dr. John R. Ashe said she would recover. It was brave of him, because in those days there were no effective antibiotics. He did not give up, and kept treating my sister with strength and courage. She spent a year in bed or a wheelchair, frail and weak.

While Ella Cornelia was ill, and during her recovery, I was actually quite healthy. Because I was healthy, and my sister needed constant nursing and attention, I was farmed out, mostly to my mother’s sister, Ola Davis, who had no children of her own. My mother felt I would be safe with Aunt Ola while she gave all her attention to Ella Cornelia.

## Family Sketches

For instance, my aunt Helen, as a teenager, about seventeen years old, had an illness, and her doctor told her family there was no cure, but if they were willing to try a potion he had been testing, he would treat her. He brought out his concoction that contained an acid that ate her teeth—all of them. She lived, but her teeth had to be pulled, and so she wore false teeth for the balance of her life, from her late teenage years to several years past her ninetieth birthday. Losing her teeth made her more shy than she might have been.

Uncle Eddie, my Dad’s older brother, didn’t resemble my Dad at all. By the time that I came along and was old enough to notice people, I wondered why my Dad was over six feet tall, and Uncle Eddie was not even as tall as Aunt Helen. He was thin, and looked frail. He had few teeth, smoked cigarettes, and on Sundays when we came to visit, spent the entire day near the kitchen stove in the winter, and in summer would sit on the porch.

Sometimes Uncle Eddie would spend part of Sunday afternoon keeping company with the man who ran a gasoline station literally “next door” to the Yandle house. The owner also had cold drinks and candy and chips for sale. I loved to go to the “filling station” where they had ice cream on sticks or in small paper bowls with tops. There were cold drinks like coca colas, Pepsi colas, Seven-ups and grape drinks in a bottle.

My Grandmother was a small woman, and I always thought of her as being frail. She birthed at least six children that I know about. One of the illnesses was called eyeritis, and it was inflammation within the eye, and it can cause blindness. That was what happened to my grandmother, and because she was already quite frail, she was never able to attend to the work needed in the kitchen, nor could she see well enough to move around in the house. She remained an invalid for the rest of her life.

## Early Childhood on East Fifth Street

My earliest memories are of the house on East Fifth Street in Charlotte, where we lived until I was about three. It was a duplex across the street from the house owned by my Great-Uncle Edward and Great-Aunt Lizzie.

I have two vivid memories from that time. One is of terror: I wandered into a small back vestibule that had no light, and the door closed behind me, trapping me in pitch darkness until my sister rescued me. The other is of beauty: sitting on the front porch floor, playing with bright crescents of sunlight cast through the arched drainage holes in the solid porch banister.

My Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward Yandle were, in my estimation at the age of five or six, two of the strangest folks I had every met. Neither of them resembled either of my grandparents. They didn’t look like either of my parents, and they behaved differently from any other aunts and uncles. Aunt Lizzie was terrified of germs; she would never touch a doorknob with her bare hand, always using her apron as a shield. Their house had both electric and gas lights—a marvel to me.

My mother told me a story about living there when my sister, Ella Cornelia, was a baby. Mother put her in a high chair on the back porch while she hung laundry in the yard. She heard the baby cooing and laughing and thought she was happily entertaining herself. When Mother returned, she found that she had placed the high chair within reach of Aunt Lizzie's prized fern. Ella Cornelia had stripped the fronds, watching the leaves drift down like green snowflakes. Mother never said what Aunt Lizzie’s reaction was, but I imagine it wasn't mild.

## Life on West Eleventh Street

I was probably close to three years old when our family moved to Eleventh Street where we lived in a two story duplex with six rooms in each side of the house—three downstairs (Living room, dining room and kitchen) and three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. The two dwellings were under one roof, and there was a shared wall which separated the two attached houses. In those days it was possible—not against the law—to rent out the upstairs of a house even though it meant that the downstairs folks had to share the bathroom with the upstairs folks, and the upstairs folks didn’t actually have a kitchen, and had to wash their dishes in the lavatory in the bathroom.

When I was about thirteen our upstairs folks who had rented all three rooms of the upstairs left the house and things were re-arranged. Mother and Daddy then placed twin beds in the third upstairs room and my sister and I had a bedroom to ourselves. I was so happy to have a room of our own, and I decided that the dingy walls needed to be refreshed, and one day talked my Dad into giving me a bucket of paint.

### Three-Center
I loved to get a snack and a drink, and there was a wonderful one when I was very young called a three center (which meant that it cost only three cents, and was sort of a poor man’s coke-a-cola). I did like the taste, and it was a wonderful treat to be allowed to follow my sister from our house down to the corner café to buy one each for a treat on a hot summer’s day. My joy of having a three-center drink died one day when I was about five years old. We had a neighbor who ran a café which my sister and I could reach without crossing a street. Ours was the first house facing Eleventh Street in the 400 block, and at the other end of the four hundredth block was Mr. Kanasas’ café. He sold a all sorts of things, like ice cream bars, and candy, and cold drinks (not to mention beer as well). He also provided food he prepared himself, and he sold hot dogs and such, and ice cream. The café was at the other end of the four hundredth block of Eleventh Street. He had a long counter that offered swivel chairs so customers could order food or drinks in comfort. At lunch he served very nice meals, though I don’t remember his serving food in the evenings. He also sold beer, and other cold drinks, and I wasn’t allowed to go to the café late in the evening, because then he had a café full of people who drank beer. But in the early afternoon I was sometimes allowed to visit the café and buy a popsicle or a drink called a Three-center. Three-Centers came in a clear bottle that looked a lot like a Coca-Cola bottle, but it wasn’t actually the same size. It wasn’t actually a Coca-Cola, but it was sort of similar, and cost only three cents. It actually looked a little like a Coca-Cola bottle, but that was truly an illusion. The bottle itself was clear, and not sort of green like Coca-Cola bottles. It was made of very thick glass. On the inside, that thick bottle held only three ounces. That illusion of a full bottle was made because the bottle which it was sold was made of a very thick glass that was Coca-Cola size on the out side, and only three ounces in the inside. I remember that bottle, and I have to this day a scar to remind me should I suddenly loose my memory.

One spring day Pete invited me to come over to play with him. He had taken one of my Dad’s empty five gallon paint buckets that had been left near the garage, and Pete was using it to play with. He turned it upside down, and then topped the bucket with a wide board that had once been the top of his sister’s play-table. He carefully laid it across the five gallon paint bucket, and invited me to sit with him. I remember that at first I refused, accusing him of trying to trick me so he could make me fall to the ground. He earnestly begged me to join him—him on one end, me on the other, so both of us could sit and talk. He promised to warn me before he jumped off the table. I fell for his plea after he promised, and I sat with him for a short period of time and we talked.

Just before we both sat on the table top on top of the bucket, Pete had used a brick to whack at a three-center bottle, and had broken it into several thick pieces of glass. Then he sat with me on the table top and we talked a little, and he suddenly, without warning, hopped off and I slid off the tilted table top onto the glass bottle, with one hand thrown out beside me to break my fall. It did, but the patch of ground under my hand was the place where the Three Center bottle had been broken.

When I got up, blood was flowing quickly from my left wrist, across my palm, through my fingers, and down onto the ground. It was not a tiny skinned place that shed a few drops—it was a artery through which my fearful heart was pumping blood with terrifying speed. It was pouring off my hand onto the ground, and splashing on my dress. I screamed—and my mother heard me. She rushed into the yard, picked me up and hurried me into the house. She caught up my sister’s clean pajamas to catch the blood, put a rubber band around my wrist as a tourniquet. Somehow she called the doctor who had saved my sister’s life when she was sick, and—believe it or not—he came in his own automobile to get me when he heard that I was bleeding so copiously and my mother had no way to take me to him—therefore he honked, mother carried me out to his car, and he drove less than a mile back to his office. He carried me in, and sewed up my wrist. I remember wearing a bandage, and I remember having to visit the doctor again to have the stitches removed. It has been more than seventy years since then, and I remember every one of those stitches to this day.

### Mean Neighbor Boy
My mother was delighted that when I was about five years old we acquired new neighbors who had a little girl close to my age. She was a bit bigger than me, but my same age. Children my age were scarce on our street, and at first it seemed wonderful to have a playmate my own age. However, my pleasure was short lived. That little girl rarely came outside without her older brother who was already in his teens. He, I discovered, had a mean streak, and thoroughly enjoyed tormenting me, since he was forbidden by his parents to torment his sister. He was not allowed to trip, or push, or hit his sister. He well knew his parents would not tolerate that—but I didn’t count, and he showed his sister how much fun it could be if the two of them finagled me into a trap where I could—and did—bet hurt. They both seemed to enjoy that. They caught me twice in their little jokes, and she dropped my only baby doll and broke it. I clearly remember one of the last tricks he played on me: He was playing with a rope, tying his sister’s feet, or her hands, and then letting her go. I was the spectator. Then he made a circle of his rope, and invited his sister to jump in and out of the rope circle while he held one end of the rope. She held the rope several times while he, himself jumped in and out. He invited me to do it, and I said no. He and his sister pretended to be having a wonderful time jumping into and out of the rope that lay quietly on the ground. Then he coaxed me to take turns with his sister and since she was doing it with me, I thought I was probably safe. me to jump in and out of the circle. When we were both playing I didn’t mind doing it. But then the little Betty wanted to do it by herself, indicating that we could do it in turns. However when I jumped into the small circle the big brother jerked the loop and tied my feet together then jerked it so that I fell hard on the ground, scraping my elbow. I was—if you want to know—not amused in the least, because my elbow was skinned, the rope put a burn on my ankles, and my dress had red dirt on it where that big boy had pulled me on the dirt. I never did trust either one of them again.

### Ice Man 'Dad'
In our neighborhood an old—sixty or seventy years—black man toted our ice in about three times a week. The ice delivery “wagon” really was a wagon—hauled by a horse. The old man was poorly clothed, and skinny. We thought he seemed “poor”—meaning he didn’t get enough to eat, and we thought he had no close family. He LOOKED hungry, and dressed cleanly, but in the same clothes day after day. My mother took pity on him and one day asked if he had eaten breakfast—since we were busy doing just that when he came in. So my mother fixed him an egg sandwich wrapped in wax paper, and a pint of coffee in a “thermos” she fashioned from a pint glass jar wrapped in paper napkins and placed inside an empty, well washed tin can that had once been a container for fruit cocktail. She called the old man “Dad” and he was most grateful. He always handed the “thermos” jar and tin back to her, always well washed and ready the next day. All through the period of the war, “Dad” drove the horse drawn ice delivery wagon, and took his breakfast with him as he went on his way. He never missed our delivery, and my mother kept on handing out his breakfast after every delivery of the ice. When the war ended he told us one day that he was retiring, and would not be coming again, and he thanked my mother for her kindness to him.

## School Days

### First Grade at Bethune
My first grade teacher was Miss Belvin. My school was named Bethune, and it was very old. It was located on North Graham Street at Ninth. I could easily walk the four blocks to school—one block from my house to Graham Street, and Two blocks to Ninth Street where the Crossing Guard stood with his stop and go sign. I arrived at the school on time, and began my adventure into learning to read, write, add, and subtract. But I also learned to take up for myself.

### The Slick Floor
The floor of my room was a problem. It was very slick because it had been treated with some sort of oil, and both desk and chairs slid very easily on the floor. Eventually it became a game for some children to knock over their chairs, so the teacher laid down a rule—if you turn your chair over, you must stand in a corner. Then came the moment when I left my chair, and when I returned it slipped out from under me and I fell and hit the floor with a bang. It hurt. However, the teacher did not run to me, help me up, nor did she ask if I was hurt. She simply ordered me to stand in the corner like a bad girl. I was outraged. She didn’t care if I was hurt. I told her, “No! I didn’t mean to do it.” She told me again to stand in the corner. I said no. I told her I had not done it on purpose, and I wasn’t going to stand in the corner. I sat in my chair and did my work. I intended never to let someone treat me like a bad girl again when I had done nothing wrong.

### Harding High School
When I entered the seventh grade, I went to Harding High School. It was unique because it housed grades seven through twelve. I was excited because for the first time I could choose some of my subjects. However, my mother insisted I take Home Economics for three years, which meant I didn't have room in my schedule for Chemistry, Earth Sciences, or Geometry. This lack of science and math credits would later cause me some trouble when I went to college at Queens, where I had to take remedial math classes.

### The Orchestra Choice
One choice I did make was to play the violin in the school orchestra. To do this, I had to give up my "free" study hall period, but I loved it. I played in the orchestra for all six years at Harding. We played for assemblies, PTA meetings, and once a year we accompanied the Junior Choir in an operetta. These were high points for me. Unfortunately, Queens College didn't have an orchestra, so I stopped playing after high school.

## Roots and Ancestry

My forebears were, most certainly, brave. A large number of my ancestors came to the United States from England in the mid-1800s, crossing the Atlantic in small sailing ships. There were two prominent families: the Yandles and the Johnstons. They intermarried frequently—Johnstons marrying Yandles and Yandles marrying Johnstons—and settled in the Carolinas, mostly around Pineville and Fort Mill, or across the Catawba River near Mount Holly.

My Great-Grandfather Yandle was a storekeeper near Pineville. During the Civil War, when the wives and children of Confederate soldiers had no money for food, he could not bear to turn them away. He would say, "Well, I SAID they needed to eat!" and give them food from his store. Eventually, his generosity caused his bankruptcy, and his younger brother, Edward Yandle, helped him settle his debts.

Grandfather and his second wife celebrated their Fiftith wedding anniversary when my father was a young lad. My dad and all the youths who were still considered “children” were warned that since there was only one dining table available, the special meal would have to be served one table at a time, with guests taking turns according to age. Therefore the young boys would be last at the table.

Hungry and bored, my father and his cousins found a box of cigars that had been a gift to Grandfather. They snitched one, went behind the barn, and took turns puffing on it. It made them all deathly sick. When they were finally called to the feast, the servers were baffled because these usually ravenous boys simply picked at their food. My Dad never smoked again.

There was also a sadness in the family that was rarely spoken of. My Dad was the youngest boy, but he wasn't the youngest child. He once mentioned a sister named Stella who died as a toddler. He said only that she was a "beautiful child." I never knew she existed until I found a chipped gravestone in a storage shed on the farm. It read "Stella Yandle." In those days, doctors often couldn't help, and families just had to bear the loss.

## The War Years

World War II changed everything. Germany had declared war on most of Europe, and on England. Radios had been available for several years, and most people had at least one. In Europe, Adolph Hitler, who had taken over the government of Germany, started a war in Europe. After that conflict was raging in Europe, the Japanese, half a world away from the United States, but already at war with China, decided to destroy the navy of the United States to prevent our country from interfering in the Pacific battles.

They sent their air force to drop bombs on the American ships anchored and stationed in Hawaii, and they tried to destroy the planes of the Army Air Force stationed in Hawaii, as well. Their surprise attack was, from the Japanese viewpoint, quite successful. They sank the navy ships in the harbor, and bombed the airfield. But that was only the beginning.

### Rationing
Ration books with stamps were issued for every person in the country. Even small children had ration books allowing the purchase of foods in precise portions. The purchase of shoes required ration stamps. If a child grew out of his shoes before the allotted time for new ones it was just too bad. Gasoline was paid for by the gallon, and measured out at the pump—but you had better have the right number of ration stamps along with the price of the gas. Meat was scarce, and vegetables or other foods that were not grown in North Carolina were expensive since shipping was now more restricted. Sugar was rationed.

### Volunteering
Children my age sometimes were drafted to do necessary, but simple chores that helped civilians—such as placing a stamp in ration books. I think I must have rubber stamped a thousand ration stamp books in one afternoon when a large number of students from my age to twelfth graders volunteered. We also helped by recycling. If we actually bought food in tin cans, we washed the cans, took out both “ends” of the can, flattened the can itself around its “ends” and I took them to school to be deposited in a basket so that they could be recovered and melted down and used again.

### The Fruit Cocktail Tragedy
Food tins were so difficult to get that many food manufacturers began to sell “canned” foods in glass jars. I remember that my mother “spent” some of our precious food ration stamps to buy a jar of fruit cocktail for a special meal. A street near our home had recently been repaved, but it had been roughly done because of shortages of materials. As she crossed that street she stumped her toe on an uneven space of the new pavement and dropped her large double armful of groceries, breaking the glass jar that held the fruit cocktail. That, of course, was the end of that! I remember that she wept, not because she fell and bruised and scraped her knees on the rough new pavement, and not because she ruined her nylon stockings, but because she had lost the fruit cocktail which could not be replaced.

### The Sugar Hoarder
Sugar was scarce, and stores were to collect ration stamps as well as the cost of sugar when it was sold. I was an eye witness the day a soldier beat up the manager of our grocery store, and then opened his storage room, picked up a sack of sugar, dropped the correct amount of money and the coupon on the check-out counter, and left. Later the police visited the young soldier, but they didn’t arrest him—as the manager had hoarded—meaning he had not planned to sell the sugar to ordinary customers. He planned to sell the sugar to bootleggers to make beer and wine.

### Dad's Contribution
My Dad had access to fuel stamps because our home was in Charlotte, though his jobs were often on the coast, and also because most painting contractors did not have the very special equipment to paint the tanks—which my Dad “invented” in order to paint the tanks. He created a rig that allowed a painter to move horizontally around the tank, then lower the board and go around again. It was dangerous work—a spark could cause an explosion—but he was proud of his solution. He had more ration stamps than an “ordinary” father because he was doing paint jobs for places like Esso Standard Oil refineries, and buildings like Camp Butner, which was a military base.

### The Shell Plant
My Aunts Martha and Ola, who lived in Pineville, did their part for the war effort too. They worked at a secret place known locally as "the shell plant." I never knew exactly where it was or what they made, but it was "hush hush." Trains leaving the plant never blew their whistles at crossings to avoid attracting attention. The most surprising thing was that my aunts, whom I had never seen in anything but dresses, wore coveralls to work!

### The Blue Star
Families with a son or husband in the service would hang a small flag with a blue star in their window. The Houser family across the street from us had a son in the Air Force, and Mrs. Houser proudly displayed a blue star. One day, the blue star was replaced by a gold star. Her son's plane had gone down over Europe. That gold star remained in her window for years after the war ended.

### Sister's Growing Up
Ella Cornelia was in the first class to complete six years at Harding High School. She graduated in 1941 and went to college in the mountains. However, she found it boring and came home at Christmas, deciding college wasn't for her. She then went to work in a doctor's office. Toward the end of the war, we learned that German prisoners of war were being kept in camps in the US and sometimes "loaned" to farmers. My sister eventually met and married Harry May, who was one of the Army guards watching over these German POWs on a local dairy farm.

### Polio and Orthodontics
I remember the polio epidemic one summer. Schools closed early, and children were confined to their yards. I couldn't go to the library or the movies. It was a lonely time. That was also the summer of my orthodontic ordeal. My teeth had grown in crooked—my "eye teeth" stuck out like tusks. My parents, despite the cost, sent me to one of the few orthodontists in Charlotte. The treatment took eight years. At one point, after four years of little progress, the doctor convinced my Dad (who distrusted doctors after what happened to his sisters) to let him pull four teeth. Finally, the braces came off. I walked home that day weeping with joy, smiling at everyone I passed, grateful to look "normal" at last.

## Meeting Paw-Paw

After college, I took a job as church secretary at Calvary Methodist Church. On my very first Sunday there, I met a young man named Robert "Bobby" Beatty. He was the great-grandson of the church's founders. We began dating in December, got engaged on Christmas Eve, and were married in June 1954.

### Bobby's Early Life
Paw-paw, whose name was Robert E. Beatty (Bobby), was born in 1925. He was an only child because his sibling died at birth. He grew up on South Boulevard in a house owned by his grandmother, Hattie Beatty. It was a busy street, right across from the "Car Barn" where the city's trolley cars were parked and repaired. Nearby was the Lance Packing Company, which made peanut butter crackers and snacks. When he was a boy, he joined the Boy Scouts and wanted to earn a badge for a fourteen-mile hike. Since he had no one to walk with him, his mother walked the entire seven miles out and seven miles back with him so he could earn his badge.

### The War Effort
When World War II began, Bobby knew he would be drafted. To have some choice in the matter, he enlisted in the Army Air Force before he graduated from high school. He trained in Florida and was eventually sent to an island in the Pacific. He endured the hardships of digging trenches and living in tents. He was scheduled to fly his first mission over Japan, which would have earned him a promotion and a raise, but the war ended the day before his mission. He was disappointed about missing the promotion!

### Finding His Way
After the war, he tried college because a girl he liked was attending, but he didn't enjoy the classes. He eventually went to work at Johnson Motor Lines, where his father was the treasurer. He started as a “step and fetch” person but moved into the office.

### Typing Lessons
It was at Johnson Motor Lines that we met. I had a manual for beginning typists from my high school days. After we were married, I taught him to type on a rented electric typewriter. He was an excellent pupil and learned to type without looking at the keys in about three weeks. This skill helped him in his work until computers came along.

### The Cat Rescuer
Paw-paw had a soft spot for animals. When he worked as a guard at a factory, he couldn't stand seeing hungry cats, so he brought them home. We ended up with quite a few cats! One cat he found at a steel plant had burned its tail off, and we took care of it. He was always kind to animals.

## Reflections

I am now seventy-five years old. My husband is eighty. We have lived through horse-and-buggy days to see men walk on the moon. We have seen the discovery of penicillin, the end of polio, and the invention of television and computers. Life has been full of changes, some sad, some wonderful. I have tried to put down these memories so that my children, Louise and Fred, and my grandchildren will know where they came from.

## A Note from Ken

I recovered these fragments of Mimi's memoir from her old computer, preserving them alongside audio recordings from my time at her home on Autumnvale Drive, circa 2008. It is a privilege to share these memories with those who knew her. She loved me dearly, as I did her, and I miss her deeply.
