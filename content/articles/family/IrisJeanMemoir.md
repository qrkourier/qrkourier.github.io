## Introduction

I am truly an elderly lady, and at the age of seventy-five, I decided to do something a lot of old folks do—think about, and then write about, events my family and I have lived through. I want to record the experiences that were delightful, those that were harder to manage, and the blessed changes in the way we live. 

Most folks would mark me as a silly old woman, as I am a very ordinary and average person. I have never been mentioned in print except for a small paragraph in *The Charlotte Observer* when I performed a dance in a kindergarten presentation at the age of five, and again in 1954, when I sent a picture of myself in my wedding gown to the paper. That has been the extent of the publicity about my life. But I hope my children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren might one day want to know more about the past and our family than history books can tell them.



## Roots and Ancestry

My forebears were, most certainly, brave. A large number of my ancestors came to the United States from England in the mid-1800s, crossing the Atlantic in small sailing ships. There were two prominent families: the Yandles and the Johnstons. They intermarried frequently—Johnstons marrying Yandles and Yandles marrying Johnstons—and settled in the Carolinas, mostly around Pineville and Fort Mill, or across the Catawba River near Mount Holly.

My Great-Grandfather Yandle was a storekeeper near Pineville. During the Civil War, when the wives and children of Confederate soldiers had no money for food, he could not bear to turn them away. He would say, "Well, I SAID they needed to eat!" and give them food from his store. Eventually, his generosity caused his bankruptcy, and his younger brother, Edward Yandle, helped him settle his debts. I never knew him, but I heard stories of his wife, my Great-Grandmother Sally Elizabeth. She lived to celebrate her fiftieth wedding anniversary, wearing a hand-sewn black silk dress that I later inherited.

There is a funny story about that anniversary. A large crowd had gathered, and because the table couldn't seat everyone at once, the adults ate first. The children, including my father who was about twelve, had to wait. Hungry and bored, my father and his cousins found a box of cigars that had been a gift to Grandfather. They snitched one, went behind the barn, and took turns puffing on it. It made them all deathly sick. When they were finally called to the feast, the servers were baffled because these usually ravenous boys simply picked at their food. My Dad never smoked again.

There was also a sadness in the family that was rarely spoken of. My Dad was the youngest boy, but he wasn't the youngest child. He once mentioned a sister named Stella who died as a toddler. He said only that she was a "beautiful child." I never knew she existed until I found a chipped gravestone in a storage shed on the farm. It read "Stella Yandle." In those days, doctors often couldn't help, and families just had to bear the loss.

## My Parents

My father, Leroy Samuel Yandle, was born in 1896 in Mount Holly. He was the youngest boy in a family of five children. He was a strong man, over six feet tall, who served in the Merchant Marines around the time of World War I, traveling to places like China. Later, he became a painting contractor.

My mother, Minnie Cole Parks, was born in 1902 near Pineville. She was the youngest child in her family. She was a skilled seamstress and a strong woman who held our family together through many trials.

## The Unexpected Arrival (1931)

I was born on February 12, 1931, in Charlotte, North Carolina. I was not the first child. My sister, Ella Cornelia, was born in November 1925. For six years, she was the only child in our family and the only grandchild in the Yandle family. She was the center of attention.

In those days, parents often did not tell children that a new baby was coming. So, when I was born, my sister had no warning. She was sent to stay with a neighbor, Pauline Funderburk, for a few days. When she returned home, she found our mother holding a baby—me. Visitors were cooing over the new arrival, ignoring the girl who had always been the star.

Ella Cornelia was shocked and angry. Her response was immediate: "Take her back!" It took many years for her to forgive me for being born, and for a long time, I was an unwelcome nuisance to her.

## Early Childhood on East Fifth Street

My earliest memories are of the house on East Fifth Street in Charlotte, where we lived until I was about three. It was a duplex across the street from the house owned by my Great-Uncle Edward and Great-Aunt Lizzie. 

I have two vivid memories from that time. One is of terror: I wandered into a small back vestibule that had no light, and the door closed behind me, trapping me in pitch darkness until my sister rescued me. The other is of beauty: sitting on the front porch floor, playing with bright crescents of sunlight cast through the arched drainage holes in the solid porch banister.

Great-Uncle Edward and Great-Aunt Lizzie were unique characters. They were brother and sister, neither ever married. They had been born in England and spoke with a different vocabulary than our Southern drawl. Aunt Lizzie was terrified of germs; she would never touch a doorknob with her bare hand, always using her apron as a shield. Their house had both electric and gas lights—a marvel to me.

My mother told me a story about living there when my sister, Ella Cornelia, was a baby. Mother put her in a high chair on the back porch while she hung laundry in the yard. She heard the baby cooing and laughing and thought she was happily entertaining herself. When Mother returned, she found that she had placed the high chair within reach of Aunt Lizzie's prized fern. Ella Cornelia had stripped the fronds, watching the leaves drift down like green snowflakes. Mother never said what Aunt Lizzie’s reaction was, but I imagine it wasn't mild.

## The Depression and Hard Times

I was born into the Great Depression. Though I was too young to understand it at the time, it shaped our lives. My father had invested in rental houses, but when his tenants lost their jobs and couldn't pay rent, he couldn't make the mortgage payments. He lost the houses and his job at the lumber yard because no one was building. He reinvented himself as a painting contractor to survive.

We were not rich, but we were never hungry. However, I remember the "bums"—men out of work and homeless—who would knock on our back door asking for food. My mother never turned them away; she would make a cheese sandwich and give them a glass of milk or coffee, which they would eat sitting on the back steps.

## Sister's Illness

When I was about three years old (c. 1934), my sister Ella Cornelia became gravely ill. She had played a vigorous game of jump rope, jumping ten games in a row to "save" her team. That night she developed a fever. It turned into pleurisy and heart trouble.

In those days, before antibiotics like penicillin, there was little doctors could do. Four doctors said she would die. Only Dr. John R. Ashe insisted she would live. She spent a year in bed or a wheelchair, frail and weak. During the worst of her illness, I was sent to live with my Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance on their farm near Pineville. 

I remember staying with Aunt Ola. She had no children and didn't run her house like my mother. One traumatic day she washed my hair, and I cried, accusing her: "You went and wet my hair!" It became a family joke, but at the time, I just wanted my mother.

## Life on West Eleventh Street

When I was about three, we moved to 407 West Eleventh Street, a duplex where we lived until I married. It was a different world then. Ice was delivered by a horse-drawn wagon for our icebox. We didn't have a telephone until I was older.

The ice man was an elderly black man we called "Dad." He looked thin and poor, and my mother, who never let anyone go hungry, asked him one morning if he had eaten. He hadn't. From then on, she made him an egg sandwich and gave him coffee in a homemade thermos (a jar wrapped in newspaper inside a tin can) every time he delivered ice. He was always grateful and returned the jar clean the next day. 

I attended Bethune School, walking the few blocks alone from the first grade. After school, I would walk uptown to "The Square" (Trade and Tryon Streets) where my mother worked in a sewing shop. I would spend my afternoons there, playing with spools of thread or watching the traffic.

One of my playmates on Eleventh Street was Pete Kanasas, the son of the Greek man who ran the corner café. Pete was mischievous. One day, he tricked me into sitting on a table balanced on a paint bucket. He jumped off, and I fell onto a broken "Three-Center" bottle (a cheap soda bottle), cutting my wrist badly. I still have the scar.

## Grandparents and Country Life

We visited our grandparents in Pineville almost every Sunday.

My **Yandle Grandparents** lived in a farmhouse without electricity or running water. My Grandmother Ella was blind and bedridden with iritis. She sat in a rocking chair in her room, and the adults would gather there to talk. My Grandfather Amos was a quiet man who sat on the porch in the summer killing flies with a swatter. My Uncle Eddie and Aunts Helen and Martha lived with them. Aunt Helen had lost all her teeth at eighteen due to a doctor's bad medicine.

My **Parks Grandparents** (Maternal) lived nearby. I remember a special Sunday when I was about five. My Grandfather Parks was getting too old to farm, and they were moving in with Aunt Ola. It was his last Sunday driving his own buggy to Flint Hill Baptist Church. He took me with him. I wore a pink dress and felt very special riding behind his old white horse, Pink.

Later, tragedy struck the Parks family. My Grandfather Parks was deaf. One day, during World War II, he walked down to the railroad tracks to cut Jimson weed for a calf. A military train, running unscheduled and silent to protect war secrets, struck and killed him.

## The War Years

World War II changed everything. I was ten when Pearl Harbor was bombed. Suddenly, there were shortages of sugar, shoes, and gasoline. My father worked away from home for weeks at a time, painting oil tanks in Savannah and other coastal cities.

My Dad actually "invented" a device for that work. The huge oil tanks had floating tops that moved up and down with the oil level to prevent fumes from gathering. Dad created a rig that allowed a painter to move horizontally around the tank, then lower the board and go around again. It was dangerous work—a spark could cause an explosion—but he was proud of his solution.

My sister worked as a nurse's aide and later in a doctor's office. Toward the end of the war, we learned that German prisoners of war were being kept in camps in the US and sometimes "loaned" to farmers. My sister eventually met and married Harry May, who was one of the Army guards watching over these German POWs on a local dairy farm.

I remember the polio epidemic one summer. Schools closed early, and children were confined to their yards. I couldn't go to the library or the movies. It was a lonely time.

That was also the summer of my orthodontic ordeal. My teeth had grown in crooked—my "eye teeth" stuck out like tusks. My parents, despite the cost, sent me to one of the few orthodontists in Charlotte. The treatment took eight years. At one point, after four years of little progress, the doctor convinced my Dad (who distrusted doctors after what happened to his sisters) to let him pull four teeth. Finally, the braces came off. I walked home that day weeping with joy, smiling at everyone I passed, grateful to look "normal" at last.

## Growing Up

I went to Harding High School, where I played violin in the orchestra. I made a dear friend, Carolyn Purcell. We helped her mother teach Vacation Bible School at First Baptist Church for years.

My sister eventually married Harry May, a soldier she met through friends. I went to Queens College as a day student, riding the bus across town.

## Meeting Paw-Paw

After college, I took a job as church secretary at Calvary Methodist Church. On my very first Sunday there, I met a young man named Robert "Bobby" Beatty. He was the great-grandson of the church's founders. We began dating in December, got engaged on Christmas Eve, and were married in June 1954.

Bobby had grown up in Charlotte, too. His grandfather had been a policeman who died at his desk, and Bobby had lived with his grandmother on South Boulevard, helping her run a boarding house for Lance Packing Company workers. He had served in the Army Air Force in the Pacific during the war.

## Reflections

I am now seventy-five years old. My husband is eighty. We have lived through horse-and-buggy days to see men walk on the moon. We have seen the discovery of penicillin, the end of polio, and the invention of television and computers. Life has been full of changes, some sad, some wonderful. I have tried to put down these memories so that my children, Louise and Fred, and my grandchildren will know where they came from.

## A Note from Ken

I recovered these fragments of Mimi's memoir from her old computer, preserving them alongside audio recordings from my time at her home on Autumnvale Drive, circa 2008. It is a privilege to share these memories with those who knew her. She loved me dearly, as I did her, and I miss her deeply.
