### hella
A "hella" is informally one metric octillion (10<sup>27</sup>) which is what you might call a large number if you're being particularly subtle about it. It was formally rejected by SI, but some non-biological entities like Google Assistant and Wolfram Alpha will convert units to hellas if you ask nicely <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
