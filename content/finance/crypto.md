## What I expect from Bitcoin

Bitcoin may be a superior store of value in direct comparison to the precious metals asset class e.g. gold. Storing value for the long term is important because inflationary legal tender on deposit in a guaranteed-liquid savings account will probably lose substantial value, and so is a poor choice for the longer term.

### As a part of my long-term portfolio

I expect Bitcoin to replace precious metals in my long-term portfolio. As such, I expect Bitcoin to have the same or better buying power when exchanged for legal tender over a time frame approximate to the average Bitcoin market cycle ~4 years, which term may be lengthening.

For comparison, I expect a diverse portfolio of stocks to have the same or better buying power within ten years.
