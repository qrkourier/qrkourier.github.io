&lt;p&gt;I am truly an elderly lady, and at the age of seventy-five, I decided to do something a lot of old folks do—think about, and then write about, events my family and I have lived through. I want to record the experiences that were delightful, those that were harder to manage, and the blessed changes in the way we live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most folks would mark me as a silly old woman, as I am a very ordinary and average person. I have never been mentioned in print except for a small paragraph in &lt;em&gt;The Charlotte Observer&lt;/em&gt; when I performed a dance in a kindergarten presentation at the age of five, and again in 1954, when I sent a picture of myself in my wedding gown to the paper. That has been the extent of the publicity about my life. But I hope my children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren might one day want to know more about the past and our family than history books can tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="roots-and-ancestry"&gt;Roots and Ancestry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My forebears were, most certainly, brave. A large number of my ancestors came to the United States from England in the mid-1800s, crossing the Atlantic in small sailing ships. There were two prominent families: the Yandles and the Johnstons. They intermarried frequently—Johnstons marrying Yandles and Yandles marrying Johnstons—and settled in the Carolinas, mostly around Pineville and Fort Mill, or across the Catawba River near Mount Holly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Great-Grandfather Yandle was a storekeeper near Pineville. During the Civil War, when the wives and children of Confederate soldiers had no money for food, he could not bear to turn them away. He would say, "Well, I SAID they needed to eat!" and give them food from his store. Eventually, his generosity caused his bankruptcy, and his younger brother, Edward Yandle, helped him settle his debts. I never knew him, but I heard stories of his wife, my Great-Grandmother Sally Elizabeth. She lived to celebrate her fiftieth wedding anniversary, wearing a hand-sewn black silk dress that I later inherited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-parents"&gt;My Parents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father, Leroy Samuel Yandle, was born in 1896 in Mount Holly. He was the youngest boy in a family of five children. He was a strong man, over six feet tall, who served in the Merchant Marines around the time of World War I, traveling to places like China. Later, he became a painting contractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother, Minnie Cole Parks, was born in 1902 near Pineville. She was the youngest child in her family. She was a skilled seamstress and a strong woman who held our family together through many trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-unexpected-arrival-1931"&gt;The Unexpected Arrival (1931)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born on February 12, 1931, in Charlotte, North Carolina. I was not the first child. My sister, Ella Cornelia, was born in November 1925. For six years, she was the only child in our family and the only grandchild in the Yandle family. She was the center of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days, parents often did not tell children that a new baby was coming. So, when I was born, my sister had no warning. She was sent to stay with a neighbor, Pauline Funderburk, for a few days. When she returned home, she found our mother holding a baby—me. Visitors were cooing over the new arrival, ignoring the girl who had always been the star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ella Cornelia was shocked and angry. Her response was immediate: "Take her back!" It took many years for her to forgive me for being born, and for a long time, I was an unwelcome nuisance to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="early-childhood-on-east-fifth-street"&gt;Early Childhood on East Fifth Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My earliest memories are of the house on East Fifth Street in Charlotte, where we lived until I was about three. It was a duplex across the street from the house owned by my Great-Uncle Edward and Great-Aunt Lizzie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two vivid memories from that time. One is of terror: I wandered into a small back vestibule that had no light, and the door closed behind me, trapping me in pitch darkness until my sister rescued me. The other is of beauty: sitting on the front porch floor, playing with bright crescents of sunlight cast through the arched drainage holes in the solid porch banister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great-Uncle Edward and Great-Aunt Lizzie were unique characters. They were brother and sister, neither ever married. They had been born in England and spoke with a different vocabulary than our Southern drawl. Aunt Lizzie was terrified of germs; she would never touch a doorknob with her bare hand, always using her apron as a shield. Their house had both electric and gas lights—a marvel to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-depression-and-hard-times"&gt;The Depression and Hard Times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born into the Great Depression. Though I was too young to understand it at the time, it shaped our lives. My father had invested in rental houses, but when his tenants lost their jobs and couldn't pay rent, he couldn't make the mortgage payments. He lost the houses and his job at the lumber yard because no one was building. He reinvented himself as a painting contractor to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were not rich, but we were never hungry. However, I remember the "bums"—men out of work and homeless—who would knock on our back door asking for food. My mother never turned them away; she would make a cheese sandwich and give them a glass of milk or coffee, which they would eat sitting on the back steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sisters-illness"&gt;Sister's Illness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was about three years old (c. 1934), my sister Ella Cornelia became gravely ill. She had played a vigorous game of jump rope, jumping ten games in a row to "save" her team. That night she developed a fever. It turned into pleurisy and heart trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days, before antibiotics like penicillin, there was little doctors could do. Four doctors said she would die. Only Dr. John R. Ashe insisted she would live. She spent a year in bed or a wheelchair, frail and weak. During the worst of her illness, I was sent to live with my Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance on their farm near Pineville. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember staying with Aunt Ola. She had no children and didn't run her house like my mother. One traumatic day she washed my hair, and I cried, accusing her: "You went and wet my hair!" It became a family joke, but at the time, I just wanted my mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="life-on-west-eleventh-street"&gt;Life on West Eleventh Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was about three, we moved to 407 West Eleventh Street, a duplex where we lived until I married. It was a different world then. Ice was delivered by a horse-drawn wagon for our icebox. We didn't have a telephone until I was older. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended Bethune School, walking the few blocks alone from the first grade. After school, I would walk uptown to "The Square" (Trade and Tryon Streets) where my mother worked in a sewing shop. I would spend my afternoons there, playing with spools of thread or watching the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my playmates on Eleventh Street was Pete Kanasas, the son of the Greek man who ran the corner café. Pete was mischievous. One day, he tricked me into sitting on a table balanced on a paint bucket. He jumped off, and I fell onto a broken "Three-Center" bottle (a cheap soda bottle), cutting my wrist badly. I still have the scar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grandparents-and-country-life"&gt;Grandparents and Country Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited our grandparents in Pineville almost every Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;Yandle Grandparents&lt;/strong&gt; lived in a farmhouse without electricity or running water. My Grandmother Ella was blind and bedridden with iritis. She sat in a rocking chair in her room, and the adults would gather there to talk. My Grandfather Amos was a quiet man who sat on the porch in the summer killing flies with a swatter. My Uncle Eddie and Aunts Helen and Martha lived with them. Aunt Helen had lost all her teeth at eighteen due to a doctor's bad medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;Parks Grandparents&lt;/strong&gt; (Maternal) lived nearby. I remember a special Sunday when I was about five. My Grandfather Parks was getting too old to farm, and they were moving in with Aunt Ola. It was his last Sunday driving his own buggy to Flint Hill Baptist Church. He took me with him. I wore a pink dress and felt very special riding behind his old white horse, Pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, tragedy struck the Parks family. My Grandfather Parks was deaf. One day, during World War II, he walked down to the railroad tracks to cut Jimson weed for a calf. A military train, running unscheduled and silent to protect war secrets, struck and killed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-war-years"&gt;The War Years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World War II changed everything. I was ten when Pearl Harbor was bombed. Suddenly, there were shortages of sugar, shoes, and gasoline. My father worked away from home for weeks at a time, painting oil tanks in Savannah and other coastal cities. My sister worked as a nurse's aide and later in a doctor's office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the polio epidemic one summer. Schools closed early, and children were confined to their yards. I couldn't go to the library or the movies. It was a lonely time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="growing-up"&gt;Growing Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Harding High School, where I played violin in the orchestra. I made a dear friend, Carolyn Purcell. We helped her mother teach Vacation Bible School at First Baptist Church for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister eventually married Harry May, a soldier she met through friends. I went to Queens College as a day student, riding the bus across town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="meeting-paw-paw"&gt;Meeting Paw-Paw&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After college, I took a job as church secretary at Calvary Methodist Church. On my very first Sunday there, I met a young man named Robert "Bobby" Beatty. He was the great-grandson of the church's founders. We began dating in December, got engaged on Christmas Eve, and were married in June 1954.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bobby had grown up in Charlotte, too. His grandfather had been a policeman who died at his desk, and Bobby had lived with his grandmother on South Boulevard, helping her run a boarding house for Lance Packing Company workers. He had served in the Army Air Force in the Pacific during the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reflections"&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now seventy-five years old. My husband is eighty. We have lived through horse-and-buggy days to see men walk on the moon. We have seen the discovery of penicillin, the end of polio, and the invention of television and computers. Life has been full of changes, some sad, some wonderful. I have tried to put down these memories so that my children, Louise and Fred, and my grandchildren will know where they came from.&lt;/p&gt;

This narrative appears to be a piece of fiction or a creative writing exercise authored by Iris Jean Yandle Beatty. While the protagonist shares the first name of Iris's mother (Minnie), the life events described—being orphaned at age four, having multiple husbands, and having no surviving children—contradict the actual biography of Iris's mother, Minnie Parks Yandle, as detailed in Iris's memoirs. Minnie Brantley is a character created by the author, perhaps exploring themes of resilience, loss, and new beginnings that mirrored her own family's values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-i-the-ending"&gt;Part I: The Ending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story opens at twilight on the day of Elmer Brantley's funeral. Elmer was Minnie's husband of nearly fifteen years, the fourth generation of his family to farm the land in Parker's Valley. He had died after a grueling three-year illness during which Minnie served as his nurse and the sole manager of the farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minnie sits on the porch swing, exhausted. She faces a painful reality: she must leave the home she has loved and worked for. Elmer’s adult children—three daughters who married military men and moved away, and one son, Clyde—do not want to keep the farm. They want to sell the land and divide the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-trouble-with-clyde"&gt;The Trouble with Clyde&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most immediate threat is Elmer's son, Clyde. Unlike his father, Clyde is irresponsible and an alcoholic. He has lost his own property and failed to support his wife and five (soon to be six) children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night of the funeral, after the guests have left, Clyde drives his truck drunkenly onto the property, crashes into an oak tree, and attempts to break into the house, screaming for Minnie. Minnie, supported by her loyal neighbors and best friends, &lt;strong&gt;Ardie and Gary&lt;/strong&gt;, calls the sheriff. Clyde is arrested, and Minnie makes the difficult decision to press charges, hoping that jail time and forced rehabilitation might save his life, even if she cannot save his inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-ii-a-history-of-loss"&gt;Part II: A History of Loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minnie's resilience is born of a lifetime of tragedy. She reflects on her history of "new beginnings," almost all of which were forced upon her by loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Orphan:&lt;/strong&gt; Born to wealthy parents, Minnie was orphaned at age four when they died in a car accident while she was staying with a temporary babysitter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lost Year:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to a miscommunication, authorities did not know where she was. She spent a year living in poverty with the babysitter's relative, an eccentric elderly woman named &lt;strong&gt;Aunt Hattie&lt;/strong&gt;, in a primitive farmhouse without electricity or running water. Minnie learned to work hard—milking cows and chopping wood—before she was finally located by her parents' estate lawyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adulthood:&lt;/strong&gt; Minnie survived three husbands and the tragic loss of her own children. She learned that "new beginnings" were a skill she had to master to survive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-iii-the-departure"&gt;Part III: The Departure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined not to watch Elmer’s farm fall into ruin or be sold to strangers while she is present, Minnie executes a meticulous plan to close down her life there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Farm:&lt;/strong&gt; She spends months harvesting the final crops, selling off the beef cattle and pigs, and finding homes for the barn cats. She cleans the barns and chicken coops until they are spotless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The House:&lt;/strong&gt; She packs only her personal belongings and the furniture she bought herself, leaving the rest for Elmer's daughters to claim or sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Decision:&lt;/strong&gt; Minnie decides to return to a piece of land she inherited from her parents—500 acres she hasn't seen since she was a child. It has been leased to a paper company for timber, but the lease has expired. She hopes the old house is still standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-iv-the-caravan"&gt;Part IV: The Caravan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bold move, Minnie convinces her best friends, Ardie and Gary, to join her. They, too, are ready for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Tuesday morning in November, a caravan departs the Brantley farm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minnie driving a new van pulling a trailer filled with chickens, goats, and pets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ardie and Gary driving a moving van.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their sons driving pickup trucks loaded with equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They leave behind the sorrow of the past years, heading toward a property Minnie barely remembers, ready to build a new life together from the ground up. It is the sixth—or perhaps seventh—new beginning of Minnie Brantley's life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Family"/><category term="fiction"/><category term="family"/><category term="resilience"/></entry></feed>
