</code></pre></div><p>I am truly an elderly lady, and at the age of Seventy-five I decided to do something a lot of old folks do—think about, and then write about, events my family and I have lived through, with hints of the experiences that were delightful, or those that were harder to manage, or to overcome, or just to live through. Over the seventy-five years of my life there have been sad, glad, terrible, and marvelous, and sometimes even blessed changes in the way all people live, and move, and have their being. When I was born in 1931 the medical community—that is hospitals, doctors, nurses, and makers of medications—had few medicines to offer to patients. There were palliatives, and life-saving surgeries, but not much at all that could truly be called medicines, as we think of them in 2007. </p><p>I was born in 1931. I was not the first child in our small family. My sister, Ella Cornelia, was born in November, six full years and a few months earlier than me. In those days different families had different rules about explaining to “innocent” children that a child was on the way. My sister was well into her seventh year, as her birthday was in November. In February of 1931 our mother arranged it with a neighbor to “invite” little Ella Cornelia to her house for a day or so, and it happened just like that. Innocent, and unwarned Ella Cornelia went with Pauline Funderburk to her house for an overnight stay, and was having a lovely time when Pauline told her to get ready to go back home. My sister had been the only—not just the only, but the ONLY—grandchild in the Yandle family, and in the Park’s family she was the oldest grandchild. She had been the star of the show for six, going a couple of months into the seventh year, being the star of the show with aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, and friends. She in no way expected even the slightest competition as the star of the show when it came to grandparents and aunts and uncles. </p><p>Ella Cornelia walked confidently into her own house, and didn’t at all understand why her mother was sitting down holding a little baby girl, with several neighbors sitting around the room, all of them paying no attention to Ella Cornelia, who was the only child in the family, and instead watching her as she beheld the fact—and it seemed to be a fact—that Mother was holding a little baby. Since I was so young I can’t offer a quote of just how I was introduced to my sister, but I heard several reports of what my sister squalled out when she actually understood that she had a baby sister. Her first, and for a long time her only unrequited wish was: “Take her back!!!”</p><p>Ella Cornelia (named for Grandmother Ella Yandle, and Grandmother Cornelia Parks so that she was accustomed to hearing her entire name as neither grandmother could be slighted just to shorten her name) was angry that her parents would actually “buy” another baby without at least warning her. She—at seven years old and happy as an only child—most definitely didn’t want a new sister who would share her very satisfactory world. It took about ten or eleven years for my sister to come to grips with the fact that Mother and Daddy were not going to “return” me to where I came from, and that that I might have some use around the house, since I learned at an early age to dry dishes and be her “hand me that” step and fetch it person. I remained unwelcome to Sis until I leaned to read music, because, since Ella Cornelia couldn’t get rid of me, she, being a month or two more than six years older than me, bossed me around without worrying about how little, or how young I was. If she was in charge of me, she was bold, and absolutely positive that I wasn’t worth much of anything. I was unwelcome to her from the beginning, and it didn’t help my sister at all that when I was two, or close to three years old, she became seriously ill. Those were days, nearly fifteen years away from penicillin, when there were no sure medications. Medicine, in those days, was mostly helpful in surgeries, injuries, and the birth of children. They could offer nursing and constant and consistent nursing, but Illness was still mostly not curable unless the patient was strong enough to simply overcome the illness with their own bodies. When most people were entered into a hospital with a truly serious disease, the patient was not at all sure he would live to return home. There was careful care—real and heartfelt on the part of the nurses. But there were no guarantees, and sometimes, from the beginning there was no hope of recovery. </p><p>For instance, my aunt Helen, as a teenager, about seventeen years old, had an illness, and her doctor told her family there was no cure, but if they were willing to try a potion he had been testing, he would treat her. He brought out his concoction that contained an acid that ate her teeth—all of them. She lived, but her teeth had to be pulled, and so she wore false teeth for the balance of her life, from her late teenage years to several years past her ninetieth birthday. Losing her teeth made her more shy than she might have been when she met people who were not kin-folk. She was an intelligent person, and she was also the oldest daughter of a woman who was blind, and who had been quite frail after birthing seven or so children. My father said that his mother had been quite fragile most of his life, and said Aunt Helen, his oldest sister, had helped to raise him. The five surviving children—two boys and three girls—sort of raised each other. My Dad was the youngest boy, and the strongest man I had ever seen. He was over six feet tall, wide shouldered, and could pick up lots of heavy things. He was a painting contractor, and climbed ladders to paint the outside and the inside of houses. He had something wonderful. He had a truck that would carry ladders, and buckets of paint along with brushes and drop cloths. He had one younger sister named Pauline who was the only sibling younger than himself. </p><p>Uncle Eddie, my Dad’s older brother, didn’t resemble my Dad at all. By the time that I came along and was old enough to notice people, I wondered why my Dad was over six feet tall, and Uncle Eddie was not even as tall as Aunt Helen. He was thin, and looked frail. He had few teeth, smoked cigarettes, and on Sundays when we came to visit, spent the entire day near the kitchen stove in the winter, and in summer would sit on the porch, or in less pleasant outdoor weather, beside the kitchen stove, or with his mother who was blind and bedridden, who lived in a room that was warm in winter, and sort of shaded by shrubs and trees in the summer. Sometimes Uncle Eddie would spend part of Sunday afternoon keeping company with the man who ran a gasoline station literally “next door” to the Yandle house. The owner also had cold drinks and candy and chips for sale. It wasn’t actually a grocery store, but there were items that were pleasing to travelers and handy to local folk who lived several miles from actual grocery stores. I loved to go to the “filling station” where they had ice cream on sticks or in small paper bowls with tops. There were cold drinks like coca colas, Pepsi colas, Seven-ups and grape drinks in a bottle. There was a tray of chewing gum, and another of candy bars. There was also a tall jar stuffed with small packages of cheese crackers that held between them delicious penut butter smeared between two crackers, with five in a package for a nickel in the earliest years, and later for a dime a little later on. I loved to get a snack and a drink, and there was a wonderful one when I was very young called a three center (which meant that it cost only three cents, and was sort of a poor man’s coke-a-cola). I did like the taste, and it was a wonderful treat to be allowed to follow my sister from our house down to the corner café to buy one each for a treat on a hot summer’s day. My joy of having a three-center drink died one day when I was about five years old. We had a neighbor who ran a café which my sister and I could reach without crossing a street. Ours was the first house facing Eleventh Street in the 400 block, and at the other end of the four hundredth block was Mr. Kanasas’ café. He sold a all sorts of things, like ice cream bars, and candy, and cold drinks (not to mention beer as well). He also provided food he prepared himself, and he sold hot dogs and such, and ice cream. The café was at the other end of the four hundredth block of Eleventh Street. He had a long counter that offered swivel chairs so customers could order food or drinks in comfort. At lunch he served very nice meals, though I don’t remember his serving food in the evenings. He also sold beer, and other cold drinks, and I wasn’t allowed to go to the café late in the evening, because then he had a café full of people who drank beer. But in the early afternoon I was sometimes allowed to visit the café and buy a popsicle or a drink called a Three-center. Three-Centers came in a clear bottle that looked a lot like a Coca-Cola bottle, but it wasn’t actually the same size. </p><p>t wasn’t actually a Coca-Cola, but it was sort of similar, and cost only three cents. It actually looked a little like a Coca-Cola bottle, but that was truly an illusion. The bottle itself was clear, and not sort of green like Coca-Cola bottles. It was made of very thick glass. On the inside, that thick bottle held only three ounces. That illusion of a full bottle was made because the bottle which it was sold was made of a very thick glass that was Coca-Cola size on the out side, and only three ounces in the inside. I remember that bottle, and I have to this day a scar to remind me should I suddenly loose my memory.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Kanasas had three children, the oldest a young man a a little older than my sister. tiny bit older than my sister, a girl a little younger than my sister but at least four years older than me. He also had a son a bit younger than me. about my sister’s age, and a younger child who was a year or so younger than me. </p><p>By the time I was moving into my teens beer couldDuring the years that the alcoholic drinks was forbidden except in a few cafes like the one our neighbor Mr. Kanasas ran was North Carolinaand a counter, behind which he could make real dinners, and he served plates with good foods and soft drinks—but he also sold beer. since it was . . . withstuffed with peanut-butter that cost only a nickel. other treats. Mr. Estridge sold bread and milk and soft drinks and candies along with a few other eatables. And many Sunday afternoons my Uncle Eddie would sit with him, and that fact meant that if I asked permission, I could take my nickel or dime down to the gas station and buy a treat for myself, all by myself. That was truly fun for me. For once, I didn’t need my sister to “take” me or accompany me to the gas station. She bossed me without mercy, and I had to be extremely nice to her or she wouldn’t take me. My parents and aunts would not allow me to wander alone beyond the borders of the yard, . nor was she required by my parents,</p><p>in the coolest room in the house. </p><p>, but I’m not sure about that. I was never told the actual agesonly five of whom lived to adulthood. Aunt Helen took over the kitchen at an early age, as her mother was blinded by an illness called eyeritis, and to this day that particular illness can still cause blindness because no cure has been found as yet. Only this year—2007—a memberof our church contracted that illness, but modern treatment, though not actually claimed as a cure-all for eyeritis, helped her enough that she did not loose her sight. </p><p>Care was available. But care did not cure if the patient was a fragile person. Care was easier in a hospital than in a home, and hospitals were available for surgeries and accidents. Sickness was about the same as it had been forever—there were few cures.</p><p>When I was nine years oldOne winter evening I went to vespers at the churc. </p><p>Ella Cornelia loved music, and listened to the radio. She would purchase (ten or twenty cents each) what was called Song Sheets, on sale in small stores. Radio was popular, as were motion pictutures, and a few people (the list growing greater every day) had phonographs that would play records of the music introduced by the growing hoard of people who watched movies in the five or six theaters in Charlotte. There were at least four, if not many more, “Five and Dime” stores in uptown Charlotte, and most of them had a piano player who would be available during the day to play on a piano the many tunes and songs published on cheap paper that had notes and words of the “popular” music offered on radio and in the moving pictures shown in theaters. About the time I was starting to school Radios were becoming easier to purchase, both because more were being manufactured, and more people were recovering from the Depression that had thrown most of the United States into a hopeless poverty that saw banks fail and close, and businesses of all sorts to simply close their doors. People without work had no money, and banks where “rich” folks had placed their wealth found that their banks, also, had no money with which to reimburse them. Things were tough all over, though I was too young to realize what a tough time people all over the South, and the North as well, often lost all their money, all their possessions including their homes, and the entire country had money problems. </p><p>Charlotte had several movie theaters, and most of them played a show only a couple of weeks before ed their ey papersung on the radio or during movies. The “Song Sheets” were published on cheap news-print paper and offered written music, or sometimes just the words, of popular songs broadcast on the radio, or shown as part of movies shown in local theatres. People who enjoyed radio often wanted to sing along with the performers, and so they bought the cheaply published song sheets to learn to both play and sing the popular tunes. oodge. somewhere in the twelve, going on thirteen years for her to admit . </p><p>not been warned of the coming event. Instead, sixth year, and moving toward her seventh birthday while I was only “expected” and so no one told her she would have a sibling. Therefore my arrival was not only a surprise to my sister, it was an insult. One day a neighbor lady came by the house and “invited” my young sister to come to her house for a visit. She went for a couple of days. Then that neighbor lady announced that she would be going home soon, and so they drove to little Ella Cornelia’s house. There was a car, or perhaps two, already parked in front of her house. Ella Cornelia went into her house and found several folks already there in the living room. Mother was sitting there holding something, and Ella Cornelia walked over to see what it was, and it was me—her infant sister. </p><p>In the 1930’s most families had a “medicine cabinet” somewhere in their house, and it would, in most instances, have a bottle of rubbing alcohol, salves that were used to fight the discomfort of colds or skin itches or such, but sulfur was about the only real drug to fight wounds. There were surgeries and protocols to help people through illnesses, but apart from those few there was little else. Medicine—as a cure-all did not exist. Measles brought the Health Department to homes and a notebook size sign was tacked beside the front door warning neighbors of communicated disease. I can remember once that after measles I was allowed to tear that terrible sign off the wall beside our family’s door the morning I was no longer contagious. My mother had to lift me up in her arms in order for me to reach it—but I was glad to snatch it off. Then I could have playmates on my porch, and then I could go outside to play. I was no longer a danger to my neighborhood.</p><p>A few years after that eager snatch to remove from our porch the warning bulletin on measles or chicken pox, there was a terrible outbreak of Infantile Paralysis in North Carolina. Not very far from Charlotte there was an outbreak of that communicable illness that was taking lives, causing crippling of its victims, and there were no medicines that would protect the helpless children and adults who were stricken, and no way to prevent the rapid spread of the disease. The Charlotte Schools closed within a few days of that outbreak. We would have a month or so longer for our not far from Charlotte. The Schools in Charlotte closed after a few days, cutting the school “year” very immediately that spring. We finished out the week, and the doors closed for the summer. Parents in Charlotte, North Carolina, were warned to protect their children by keeping them indoors where they were unlikely to mingle with neighbors, never take them into a crowd such as school class-rooms, or churches, or movie theaters. Adults were warned to keep their children away from other children, and so there were no trips to stores of any sort, nor of churches, and certainly not movie theaters—and that was long before television. Older siblings, or parents could borrow books from the library for children to read, and there were radio programs aimed at young people, but at home. No visits to movie theaters, or parks, and no playing with neighborhood children. lsis. nailed beside our door, another there came a different kind of quarantine to the City of Charlotte, N.C. The “new” one was not really new, but I had not heard very much about it. Not far from Charlotte an epidemic occurred. I think I was in about the third grade, and that year school was over for the year more than a month early, as I remember it. School simply stopped right there. Children, and some adults, in a nearby area were suffering from what my parents called “Infantile Paralysis” and what I learned years later was Poliomilitus. </p><p>illnesses that surgery would help, there really wasn’t much to offer or other quite ordinary ches and pains, but most of the remedies were ineffective, and served mostly as proof of “doing something” to help pain or discomfort. There were very few effective palliatives. Most home made remedies were an effort to actually “do” something to help the suffering, whether or not it was effective. I know that my family had such items. When I had a cold, my mother rubbed my chest with Vicks Vapor Rub, or metholatum. 888888888888888888888888888 </p><p>tumif sulfa couldn’t cure an illness, folks were mostly out of luck. There were no antibiotics at that time. There were few “medicines” on the market that actually did what they were advertised to accomplish. Physicians, sometimes in desperation, tried untested combinations of the “remedies” that were offered, but most of those concoctions were either destructive or ineffective and worthless, so that people who were desperate for a helpful medication were often given unproven medicines, because to a dying person something that might help them was always more comforting that the news that there was no remedy. </p><p>My Grandmother was a small woman, and I always thought of her as being frail. She birthed at least six children that I know about. I’m not certain about the order of birth, but I was aware that Aunt Helen was the oldest daughter, and that Uncle Eddie was older than my Dad. I also knew that Aunt Pauline was the youngest, so that left Aunt Martha the middle girl, but she was the Aunt who was very bossy. When I was very small my Aunt Pauline had a boy friend who eventually became my Uncle Henry. I must have been four or five years old at the time, but I liked Uncle Henry, and I remember that I solemnly told my Aunt Pauline, that she couldn’t marry Uncle Henry because I, at the very young age of four or five, was going to marry Uncle Henry. Despite my plea, Aunt Pauline married Uncle Henry, and they rented a house so near my Grandmothers house that it took only three minutes to walk there. As I grew up I had wonderful Sunday afternoons at Aunt Paulin9999999999999999e spent most of the afternoon with her visiting Aunt Pauline’s house on Sundays, when I had her living room . Aunt Pauline and Uncle Henry were at my Grandmother’s and the grown-ups were having a nice time talking, and I was having a nice time wearing Aunt Pauline’s satin housecoat while listening to Gene Autry on the radio. , and listening My visits Most of the time she and Uncle Henry were at my Grandmother’s house. , and Aunt Pauline had a beautiful satin house coat that I loved to put on, and just sit by her radio and listen to a thirty minute program staring Gene Autry, one of my favorite cow-boys. Aunt Pauline was very nice to let me have that lovely time in a nice house, listening to a wonderful cow-boy show, and looking at my reflection in her mirror wearing a wonderful sat housecoat. </p><p>Never the less, for all of my boasting, she managed to marry him first, and they seemed to love each other very much. There was a house available for rent that was really close to house where my grandparents lived. </p><p>The land my grandparents lived on was very near a red dirt road that went from the Pineville highway along side of my Grandparent’s land, all the way to the railroad. Then that unused road seemed to keep right on going across a grassy field. I asked my Dad where the road went. He told me it didn’t really go anywhere now, but that at one time there was a building out in that field, but it had burned down. Some years later there was a Sunday when my Mother and Dad decided to take a walk. We walked up that red dirt road, and crossed the railroad tracks and kept walking. , and I went with them up the red dirt road, and across the railroad tracks. We kept walking Took a short walk across that track, and followed the narrow level red </p><p>There was one little The house my grandparents lived in was next to a red dirt road that now led absolutely no where except into a field that grew nothing much but grass. As I grew up my Dad would sometimes Their first home was a rental, and was the second house though I was quite young, I decided their house was a half block away from my Grandparent’s housewas just about the length of half a block before I was old enough. Even so, I always did like that gentleman, and he was always kind to me. For many years Aunt Pauline and my Dad were the only two married children in that family. After Aunt Pauline and Uncle Henry lived almost close enough to the house my Grandparents lived in to toss was married she no longer lived in the house with my grandparents and my other two aunts and my Uncle Eddie. Aunt Pauline didn’t move very far away. There was, actually, only one house between the house Aunt Pauline and Uncle Henry rented and the house in which the rest of his immediate family lived—except, of course for my Dad and Mother and my sister and me. We lived in Charlotte, but nearly every Sunday afternoon we went to see my grandparents, and often it was not only the Yandles, but also my mother’s parents, the Parks family.</p><p>that cameand visited nearly all of my Dad’s family lived where my Dad grew upwas so bossy it didn’t take much to know that she was older than Aunt Pauline, that though I seemed to know of my aunts and uncles; however, I think Uncle Eddie and Aunt Helen were the two oldest, and then my Aunt Martha. I think that my Dad (Leroy Samuel) was next, then Aunt Pauline. For years I was not aware that there had been another child in that family. One day I followed my Uncle Eddie into the There was another child whose name was Stella, but she died when she was still a toddler. My Dad spoke of her only once, when he said sadly that she was a beautiful child. I had never heard of that name until one day I asked for a rake or some other garden tool, and my Uncle Eddie took me into the barn yard to a small square storage hut to get the tool. On the ground before the shed was a scuffed up slab of marble almost buried in the dirt of the barn yard. I turned it over, and discovered that it was a grave stone, with a name etched into it. The name was Stella Yandle, and she had died very young. I asked my Dad about almost in the with a found near a small a chipped grave stone with her name on it </p><p>When I was old enough to notice how a house was run I discovered that Aunt Helen was the one who ran the kitchen, but Aunt Martha helped her, and also assumed the position of “chief nurse” to my Grandmother, who was an invalid, and was blind. My Grandfather Amos along with my uncle Eddie ran the farm. Aunt Helen was the cook, though Aunt Martha helped her, and helped to care for Grandmother. My Aunt Pauline and done a wondrous thing not often heard of in the South in those days: she had gone to college. After her graduation Aunt Helen went to work for an engraving company, and she worked at that job until she retired many years later. . looked after my grandmother and I think my Aunt Helen was the first child. , and she grew up helping to care with the other children, and also helping in the kitchen. In those days it was a rare family that did not lose small children to illnesses. My Grandparents raised five children, my Dad being the youngest boy. There were two girl children younger than my Dad, however, only one lived to adulthood. My Aunt Pauline was the youngest child, and she attended college. I don’t think my Uncle Eddie or my Aunt Helen attended school long enough to actually graduate, though they were both intelligent and knowledgeable people. My Aunt Martha and my Aunt Pauline actually finished school, because Aunt Martha planned to become a nurse, but because she became ill she was unable to complete her training. My Aunt Pauline, the youngest child, actually went to college. They had to take on rather adult positions within their families at an early age. My Dad left school after the firstAs the oldest children they had to help Aunt Martha enrolled in a nursing Pauline was the only one of the family that went to college. , and First there were two girls and one boy, and Their first child was a girl who was named Helen. In the early 1900’s , though Helen, their oldest daughter, spoke of having to take care of the kitchen at a very young age. and her oldest girl, my Aunt Helen, took over the kitchen work at an early age. My Dad was the fourth child, though not the youngest in the family. Two more children were born, though only one livedand there were at least two children born awhen he was youngBefore my sister not well after she started having babies. I know she had at least six, and probably more children. Five of them lived to adulthood. My Dad remembered that there was a little girl whom he thought was quite beautiful as a child. She died from an illness when she was a toddler. I didn’t know she had ever existed named Stella who died as a very young child. </p><p>In most instances the physicians who prescribed for patients who were dying from an illness for which there was no effective antidote, often put together some sort of tonic that might help. Otherwise he had to say there was no help. Rather than doing absolutely nothing he often created a medicine that he hoped would provide whatever seemed to be lacking in a patient’s system. The medicine he gave Aunt Helen turned out to have a genuinely active reaction; though that reaction left a great deal to be desired. The medication dissolved the enamel of her teeth, and before she was twenty years old she was wearing false teeth. Aunt Helen was not an outgoing sort of person to begin with, as she had been cooking the meals for the family for years. Grandmother Ella Yandle became an invalid quite early in her married life. She gave birth to at least six children, and suffered a number of illnesses when she was relatively young. One of the illnesses was called eyeritis, and it was blind, and very frail. t was what caused my Aunt Helen to loose all her teeth. This I know because a doctor in Pineville tried to help my Aunt Helen when she was eighteen or so, and provided her with a liquid medicine that ate the enamel from her teeth. She survived the illness and the medication, but at the age of eighteen she lost all of her teeth. Of course it affected how she lived, and though she eventually wore dentures, she never married. Aunt Helen, and her brother, Uncle Eddie, seldom left the house. There was a filling station that sold cold drinks, snacks, and cigarettes that was next to on Pineville Road, only a hop and a skip from my Grandparent’s home, and the man who ran that station was, I think, the only friend my Uncle Eddie had. Uncle Eddie’s life consisted of taking care of the animals (cows, mule, pigs) and the fields where he did the plowing, sowing, and harvesting. I don’t know how much schooling he had, but my Aunt Pauline was the only one of my Dad’s siblings who finished high school and then went to college. the fields The man who ran it was about Uncle Eddie’s only friend. She lived on the farm owned by her parents, and became the cook and house-keeper when her mother was blinded by an illness called eyeritis. </p><p>Strangely, just this past week, I was advised that a woman attending our church had contracted that disease. There is still, in 2006, no medication that will make eyeritis go away. I know that it is painful, but I don’t know much else about that illness beyond the fact that it caused my Grandmother pain, and she became blind, never even knowing what my sister or me really looked like. She was old, of course, and very frail. She had a rocking chair with cushions, and she moved only between her bed and her chair for the rest of her life. One day when my Dad wanted to do some hammering and sawing and painting on the house, he and Uncle Eddie picked up Grandmother’s rocking chair while she sat in it, and carried her, chair and all, a short distance to Aunt Pauline’s house where she sat in comfort while Daddy did some work on her house and her room. My part of that afternoon was to keep Grandmother company, and put drops in her eyes when she needed them. , and I never knew her when she could walk </p><p>inflammation within the eye, and it can cause blindness. That was what happened to my grandmother, and because she was already quite frail, she was never able to attend to the work needed in the kitchen, nor could she see well enough to move around in the house. She remained an invalid for the rest of her life. </p><p>As I was growing up, more and more antidotes were being discovered. I was twelve, or perhaps thirteen, when I received my first Penicillin injection. medicine—with a capital M</p><p>Strangely I heard very recently—in 2006—that eyeritis was still an incurable disease. It affects the eyeball, and my grandmother became completely blind as a result of that illness. She never actually saw either my sister or me, and there was no medicine, nor treatment of any kind that would help her, except for a small bottle of fluid that seemed to soothe the pain she often suffered. In my memory I can still hear her rather pathetic request, “Put some drops in my eyses,” she would say. She required frequent applications of eye drops to avoid pain tto </p><p>for her parents and her brother; Eddie, who, as a very young boy was injured by a mule kick. Though he lived a long time, he tired easily, and after my grandfather died, Uncle Eddie depended a great deal on his younger brother, my Dad. Daddy would leave his own business at sowing and at harvest time, helping his brother with both planting and harvesting. Uncle Eddie never had a tractor. He had a mule that pulled his plow. They never had to buy milk at a grocery store. They kept cows, made their own butter, and actually never bought loaf bread at a store. Aunt Helen made her own loaves of whole-wheat bread or pans of biscuits. They had chickens, pigs, cows, and a mule, usually a bunch of cats, as well as at least one dog. When I was very small my Dad was the only one of their children not living at home. Aunt Pauline was the youngest child in my Dad’s family, and she was the one of the two girls who actually graduated from high school. My Aunt Martha graduated, and she began her training as a nurse at Presbyterian Hospital soon after she graduated. My Dad’s youngest sister, Pauline, also enrolled in college; and I think she graduated, and not so long afterwards, married. She and her husband rented a house very close to the Yandle farm so that she and her husband would be quite close to her parents. since her mother was truly an invalid.however, went to school until she graduated, and then went on to college. As a young adult she took a job with a publishing company in Charlotte, eventually bought a car, and commuted to Charlotte every work at that job until she retired in her old age. Aunt Pauline dayworked for that sambreadand help pick cotton, or harvest the corn or grains. My Dad also looked after their house, providing any repairs that were needed, and when I was in High School he built a small room with a door, and near the roof of that room he placed a window, and a toilet. at the end of their back porch. How he managed, I don’t really know, but he installed running water into the house (they had always carried water from a well) and when he was finished there was a toilet, which was much onto their house where he installed a modern toilet. At harvest time my Dad had to help Uncle Eddie , though she outlived all her siblings except for her for the rest of her life, which was spent in the home she was born in, along with her older brother who had been injured as a youth, and was never as strong nor as sure nor as active as my Dad. not actually have effective drugs to suggest to their patients. There were no true antibiotics. Sulfa was one of the very first, and most people realized that drinkable alcohol would dull pain, though it had side effects that were not at all helpful. Doctors truly wanted to help their patients, and actually they did. Some years before I was born one of my Dad’s sisters had a problem, and her physician There were a number of over-the-counter items that seemed to help. But there were few, , though there were lots of pills, that were, to some extent, . Yet some of the behaviors that are prominent in this day and in this time are neither new, nor good for people, whether or not someone is watching those events. Some times an idea that seems marvelous turns out to be harmful, and we all know that not every good deed is actually good, nor is every accidental change in the way we live always terrible. The attempts to improve our lives as we live and move and have our being sometimes bring defeat instead of victory, pain instead of healthhow we live and move and have our being can be either wonderful and powerful or terrible and never very old, avenues available in this Twenty-First Century are neither beautiful nor healthy or good for mankind, and yet they openly, enticingly exist, and often have no warning signs that admit that the glittering and seldom do such “opportunities” have warning signs that reveal the against such indulgences. Instead, there are advertisements urging the unwary to partake of excitement and pleasure, despite the difficulties that could arise from unwise use of some of the new and enticing eresting , but dangerous, opportunities. First there were motion pictures, and at their beginning they were fairly gentle and careful, often simply funny representations, made for all audiences, and along with radio which was also growing, there were interesting and amusing ways . Then there was radio entertainment, and to be frank, I don’t really know which came first—the phonograph, or the movieswith careful rules to prevent programs from giving offense. </p><p>Motion pictures improved, and rules were set to prevent nudity, and to protect yothere were special laws established to prevent the portrayal of motion pictures Then there is also television. In the early years of television there were strict rules about what could be portrayed before cameras, as there was about what could be said or sung on radio. Motion pictures also adhered to rules that kept filth off the screensand protection against ugliness and filth in the earliest days. Now you can find nudity, foul language, actors portraying sexual misconduct, very ugly fights, murders, </p><p>I can’t write much about my babyhood as I have only scattered, tiny flashes of memory, of my life before I started to school. Actually, during some of my earliest years I was not, as the baby, the center of attraction in my family. My sister was about six years older than me, and my family lived on East Fifth Street at that time. when she was in grammar school, probably either the third or fourth grade, there was a day when she played jump rope with her schoolmates. The school she was attending was very old. By the time I started to school Some of the rooms had been roped off as unsafe for use, and the playground, which I saw some years later, was not grassy nor was it furnished with slides or swings. By the time I saw it the school was no longer in use,re was little or no she became ill, quite suddenly when she was she was nine or ten years old. Because her illness was both quick and deadly, at least five doctors at Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina, examined her. Four of those doctors said that in their opinion there was no hope of her recovery, and it would be better to keep Ella Cornelia as comfortable as possible until she died, because she would never again be really well and healthy. Dear, dependable Dr. Ashe said she would recover. It was brave of him, because in those days there were no effective antibiotics. There were few if any of the wonderful medicines available today. My sister had pleurisy, and her illness affected her heart. </p><p>The year was 1933 or 1934. Of course she was taken to a physician immediately when she developed a fever, and she was fairly quickly admitted to Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte, N.C. One of the four or five physicians who examined her was Dr. John Ashe, Pediatrician. In those days there were no actual antibiotics, at least not as we know them today. Doctors could deliver babies, operate when people had appendicitis, and other illnesses, however, truly effective . . My Mother My sister’s illness began in the early 1930’s. </p><p>T It would either overcome the illness, or succumb to it. Of course there were palliatives for illnesses, but though they reduced pain, they did not actually fight the diseases. Sulfa had been a true help to fight infections, but it didn’t always work. </p><p>When my sister, six years older than me, became seriously ill, I was about two or three years old, and required a lot of attention, as would any other child my age. Because my mother needed to give all of her attention to my very ill sister, I was farmed out to her sister, my Aunt Ola, who had no children of her own, but had helped to raise her siblings who were now all adults , though they were adults, and married. </p><p>I was twelve, or thirteen years old in the 1940’s when I received my first penicillin shot. It was put on the market after the beginning of World War II. </p><p>If a person was strong and otherwise well, there was often a chance that his own , though no true promise, of recovery. For some years when I was a child people who went to the hospital were far more at risk of their lives than occurs today. The generation that included my parents saw wondrous improvements in the field of medicine. And I, myself, was among the earliest patients in Charlotte, North Carolina, to use penicillin. I was aware that most people resisted going to a hospital because the seriously ill more often than not didn’t come out alive. Hospitalization was often considered the last resort, when there was no genuine hope for recovery. For some illnesses that is still true today. But the marvelous treatments available today make </p><p>before but it wasn’t nor were there new and wonderful treatments, or machines, or special new inventions that would help her. </p><p>you can as , and only prayer and the attention of dear old Dr. Ashe stood between my sister and her predicted death. My sister, Ella Cornelia, was six years and a few months older than me. My parents had been married about a year when Ella Cornelia was born. Then came the Great Depression which hit the North with terrible and immediate devastation of bank holdings and savings, businesses and jobs. When businesses closed, their workers had no income. Working people suddenly had no jobs, and rushes to the banks to withdraw savings caused banks to close their doors, denying their customers access to their savings. People without jobs or money couldn’t pay either rent or promised amounts to mortgages, , and therefore jobs working people South with its terrible and devastating difficulties were married </p><p>One day recently while I was talking to my older sister on the telephone, she asked me if I actually had memories of living in the house on East Fifth Street in Charlotte. She, being a little more than six years older than me, had quite vivid memories of that home. I, because infants rarely remember ordinary events, and very young children seldom comprehend or before they are at least three or four years oldSince we had moved from that house when I was not quite three years old she was curious about how much I remembered about living there. </p><p>since that was the house our family lived in when I was born. Since we moved away from that house when I was very young it seemed unlikely that I actually did remember the interior of the house. Since my Dad’s Aunt and Uncle lived directly across the street from that house, my parents often reminded me each time we visited Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward—little older than a toddler. Because Since my Dad’s uncle and aunt lived across the street from that house and we visited them frequently, I was aware , for about twenty yearssaw the outside of that house frequently as I was growing up because my Grandfather Yandle’s sister and brother lived precisely across the street from the duplex we lived in when I was a baby, and we visited them on Sundays about once every month while I was growing up. </p><p>All children everywhere understand some things about people that their family visits often, even when they don’t really perceive all the reasons why their parents visit certain people, or don’t visit others. Small children simply accept the fact that they will be seeing some old people. At least that was the way I felt. </p><p>My Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward Yandle were, in my estimation at the age of five or six, two of the strangest folks I had every met. Neither of them resembled either of my grandparents, and certainly not any of my other aunts or uncles. They didn’t look like either of my parents, and they behaved differently from any other aunts and uncles, or grandparents, in our fairly wide family when you consider that there were three generations of us, including two sets of grandparents, and two sets of aunts and uncles who were really just brothers and sisters of both my parents. And since my Mother’s brother had married and had three children who lived within driving distance of Pineville, we had three cousins, and lots, and lots of older people who were cousins of our parents. When I was small we went to picnics in the summer down in somebody’s pasture when people of all ages gathered about once every year, and all those who attended brought food that was laid out on picnic tables so that everybody could eat all they wanted, and the tea was cooled in large metal tubs like the one’s my mother used when she washed our clothes every week, only these tubs had ice in them, keeping the tea cool. So far as I was concerned, I was flabbergasted by the fact that we ate from plates made of paper, and drank from cups made of waxed paper so they wouldn’t leak. I loved to collect and save the paper cups others discarded. Mother allowed me to play with them until they disintegrated—however I never tried to drink out of them. They were wonderful, for a short while, to play with in the sand pile. </p><p>. Across the street from that house , going on four years old. The year was 1933 or 1934. I had to think for several moments, and then I told her of two memories: one was of a dark, frightful place that I couldn’t escape, and the other was bright half circles on the floor. My sister, Ella Cornelia Yandle May told me that the dark place where I was frightened was a tiny entry at the back of the house, and that there</p><p>when I was about two and a half years old I managed to trap my small self in the back hall of our house where there was either no light at all, or one beyond my reach. I was, of course, quickly rescued. I’ve always had a loud mouth, and on that occasion I let out a scream that quickly brought my sister to help me. My other recollection of living in that abode was of the bright spots on the front porch floor. The banisters were unusual as they were solid from railing to the floor, much like a half wall. However, at intervals there was a crescent shaped opening cut through that solid wall to allow rain water to drain off the porch floor. When the sun was shining, those crescents were bright sun lit half circles on the porch floor that was otherwise quite dark in the shade of the solid banister, and I remember trying to pick up those lovely bright arches. on an otherwise shaded area, and I remember that I tried to pick up the beautiful half circle. I was probably close to three years old when our family moved to Eleventh Street where we lived in a two story duplex with six rooms in each side of the house—three downstairs (Living room, dining room and kitchen) and three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. The two dwellings were under one roof, and there was a shared wall which separated the two attached houses. In those days it was possible—not against the law—to rent out the upstairs of a house even though it meant that the downstairs folks had to share the bathroom with the upstairs folks, and the upstairs folks didn’t actually have a kitchen, and had to wash their dishes in the lavatory in the bathroom. It also meant that the downstairs folk had total control of the hot water tank. Granted, it was awkward for the person who did the cooking and dishwashing up stairs, and awkward for the down stairs folks who had to use the bathroom upstairs, but we managed, and so did the people in the other side of our duplex who also had two families in their side of the house. </p><p>When I was about thirteen our upstairs folks who had rented all three rooms of the upstairs left the house and things were re-arranged. Only two of the upstairs rooms were rented to a newly wed couple, who had a bed-sitting room and a smaller room that served as their kitchen. Mother and Daddy then placed twin beds in the third upstairs room and my sister and I had a bedroom to ourselves, and mother and Daddy had a bedroom between the kitchen and the living room, all by themselves. My sister and I slept on a double bed, and had a nice window that looked out over the back yard. From our window we could see the steeple of the Tenth Avenue Presbyterian Church, and hear its bells. Our window allowed us to enjoy any breeze that happened along, and we had—wonderful and marvelous for our own use—a radio. There was a small closet for our dresses, and we were just across the hall from the bathroom. We couldn’t “hog” the use of it because there was a young family renting the other two upstairs rooms, which meant we had to keep our door closed, but we enjoyed our own radio, and being able to listen to what we wanted to hear, and during the winter when the door was closed our parents could not hear that we were listening to late night programs on the radio. </p><p>When we had enjoyed our upstairs room for about two years, the family that had rented the other two rooms upstairs bought themselves a house, and then our family had six rooms—three downstairs, and three upstairs. Mother and Daddy moved upstairs, too, and we had another room that was sort of an “all purpose” room. Mother could sew there, we kept the washing machine there, and it became a place to store our bathroom towels and wash clothes, as well as out of season clothing. I had outgrown my dolls and my doll baby carriage, and they were stored in the extra room, which actually had a small closet in it, and all of us could use it for out of season clothing. </p><p>I was so happy to have a room of our own, and I decided that the dingy walls needed to be refreshed, and one day talked my Dad into giving me a bucket of paint. </p><p>with three windows instead of the one window we had at the back of the house. We could have twin beds, instead of sharing a double bed, and we had a nice sized closet for our clothes. We now had a dressing table that had a very nice mirror, and in our closet we could store our under clothes as well as hang our dresses, and my sister, who had five or six pairs of shoes had a place to keep them. ies as well We also had a chimney in that room, and Daddy put a warm morning heater in the room so that we could build a fire in it during the winter. moved our bedroom into a larger front room that had a large closet in it. Our parents took what had been the renting family’s kitchen as their bedroom, and then we had a junk room where we kept our newest and most wonderful modern item: a washing machine. Up until then we had washed clothes in the kitchen in two big wash-tubs, using a scrub board to get dirt out of my dad’s work clothes. We filled the tubs using our largest cooking pot to transfer water from spigot to tub. It took a lot of energy to transfer water from spigot to tub. Now we had an “attachment” that allowed us to fill the tub form the faucet, and a wonderful wringer to push the washed or rinsed clothes through—one that got out most of the water, it still took a long time to wash a week’s worth of clothes because we still had to run every rag we washed through the wringer, and then hang the clothes on a line in the back yard. </p><p>though we continued to use one tub of rinsing water as that had to be filled from the kitchen sink with bucket by bucket of water. Now we could affix a hose and fill the washingmachineby unless they came upstairs to the bathroom. not being in the room with Mother and Daddy a breeze when easily from our window, and at last could open our window at night in the summer to enjoy a breeze should one happen to be moving in the warm summer months. toThe last family that shared the house with us had only two roI was, I think, about ten or twelve years old before we could afford to pay rent for all six rooms just for our family. Then one day the Nance family moved out with their little red haired baby, and my sister and I took the largest room at the front of the house with three windows, and Mother somehow provided two single beds, one for each of us. We had a dressing table with a mirror, a stove for warmth in winter, and wonderful, wonderful large closet—something we had never had before—just for our own use. Our parents used another room where they had a closet, and they already had a bedroom suite and for a change they could use the double bed for themselves, because for a long time my sister and I had slept in the double bed, while our parents slept Eventually the upstairs people moved out, and my parents took one of the upstairs rooms as their bedroom, and placed my sister and I both in the same room , and I lived in that house with my sister and my parentsuntil I was married. </p><p>also quite awkward for both the people downstairs who had to share the bathroom. However both sides of our duplex housed two families, making four families under one roof. Togetherness was satisfactory only if everyone cooperated, and for the most part our family fared pretty well during the years we shared the house with other folk. The Depression era was still pinching families in the South, mostly because jobs were still scarce, and money was tight. My own memories of our early years in that house were that we lived in only two rooms: our kitchen and our bedroom. We had access to, and could use, the “front” room, however we had no furniture, and couldn’t serving as home to two families per side. It was the depression era, and such problems were simply dealt with because otherwise people couldn’t afford to rent a roof over their heads. </p><p>first floor kitchens and hall, including the staircases. </p><p>and the upstairs back bedroom and the staircases like mirror images of each other, with a single wall serving as the partition between them. The year I started first grade there was a family living </p><p>Strangely, the front porches did not connect, though the roof that covered both The kitchen, and the front hall of each house shared a single wall. that included a staircase had both front and back porches, but very little yard. . amily moved to Eleventh Street as they were shingled like a roof from the railing to the floor all the way around the porch. To prevent rain from pooling on the porch there were very small crescent shaped arches at intervals to allow water to run off. When the sun was positioned just so there was a bright made a bright crescent shaped shining had an arched opening that allowed rain water to drain off the porch floor. level with the floor that would allow rain to drain off the porch floor. shapeedIn those days that were definitely pre-air conditioning, the front porches were considered necessary, and in the city there were few houses that didn’t have a front porch with wooden chairs and a swing. Most of the porches were several feet off the ground, and they usually had a banister surouncing them. Most, though no all, porches had a railing to prevent people from falling off the porch. into bushes or ing yearHere in the South most of the houses had porches, usually furnished with “outdoor furniture” such as sturdy rocking chairs and/or bench shaped swings that hung from the ceiling. hat would hold at least two persons, while the constant movement of the swing would provide a soft breeze on warm evenings in the summer. Most porches offered little privacy, but were enclosed by railings upheld by inch square uprights that protected babies and old folks from falling off the porch, but didn’t hinder sunshine or cooling breezes, or wind driven rain. The porch at the front of our house on East Fifth Street was different. The banister was like half of a wall that reached a little more than three feet from the floor. To prevent rain from standing on the porch floor, there were at intervals a small opening that arched in a half circle at intervals all around that otherwise solid banister. I remember playing on the floor, and trying to touch the very bright half round arch only about four, or perhaps five, inches high at three or four inchesto allow , or rather, half a wall. The folks who sat on that porch had a lot more privacy than most porches. The builders that went only . were surrounded by a railing made of slender inch square banister with inch-square “pillars” that rested on which did not usually hinder full vision of the yard since the railing usually rested on small wooden upright, usually only inch square d hung on chains from the ceiling, and banisters usually surrounded the porch if it was more than a foot off the ground so that small children wouldn’t fall off the porches. or swings benches, and perhaps a wide swing that would accommodate at least two or more persons, and in the South, many of the porches were screened in to protect from bugs. surrounded by banisters that provided valuable safety against strong winds carrying off light-weight chairs, or children or unwary adults from stepping off the edge of a porch floor into bushes or other undesirable a careless step off the edge of were different in the house we lived in at the time. Instead of being a railing with narrow little poles holding it up, as is more usual nowadays, the porch of the house on East Fifth Street where we lived when I was less than three years old had a solid banister, except that at intervals there were small arched openings along the floor to allow rain run off. Since we moved away from that house when I was three years old, that memory is somewhat like a quick flashback—it has no beginning, nor does it have an end. It is of me, sitting in the shade of the solid banister, patting the bright arched reflection of the sun on the floor of the porch. I probably would have totally forgotten any small memory of that house had I not seen it many times as I was growing up. My Great Uncle Edward, and his sister, Great Aunt Elizabeth (called Aunt Lizzie) lived just across the street from that house my parents rented when I was so very young. It was not until I had a child of my own that my mother mentioned to me that our family had once lived in the 500 block of East Fifth Street in Charlotte. </p><p>When my parents were first married they lived with my Dad’s aunt and uncle. When I was old enough to understand that aunts and uncles were the sisters and brothers of my parents I was somewhat confused, because Aunt Elizabeth looked as old as the hills, and my Dad was quite young looking in comparison. Uncle Edward didn’t look quite as old Aunt Elizabeth, but I thought he was the strangest sort of person I had ever met. Both Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward me a lot better than I knew who they were, and what they were going to do, and so forth had a different vocabulary from anyone else in our family, and he definitely did not have a Southern drawl. His speech was always short, to the point, with no nonsense to it at all.</p><p>Those two people, Aunt Elizabeth (whom we called Aunt Lizzie) and her brother Edward Yandle, really were odd, and not like any of my other aunts or uncles. My Dad had three sisters and one brother, and my Mother was the younger of two girls, and she also had two brothers. None of them were as old as Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward. I think I must have been about eighteen when I finally realized that Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward were siblings, not of my Dad, but of my Dad’s father, or perhaps not him either. They were probably sisters of my Grandfather Yandle999999999999999999999999999999. married befor was a door to door salesman of a great many items such as Mentholatum, and/or Vicks Vapor Rub, </p><p>I thought all uncles had a wife who was an aunt. If they were uncles and aunts, they were brothers or sisters of my parents; however, Uncle Edward and Aunt Elizabeth didn’t fit any pattern I had ever learned about. My Grandmother Yandle was a skinny little old lady with very long black hair worn in a bun at the nape of her neck, and I never saw her in a dress. She wore night gowns with a lightweight house coat on top of it. Grandmother Yandle was an invalid, and blind. She had suffered from an illness that caused inflammation in her eye—not just on the outside of her eye, but the inside of it. She could upon some occasions tell whether or not it was dark outside her window, but she never actually saw either my sister or me, though she heard our voices often. There had been no medicine that would battle the illness. There was none when she lost her vision a little more than eighty years ago. To my surprise, by the time I, myself, had several grandchildren, I heard again that a lady in our church had eyritis. </p><p>, and had a way of talking that was totally unlike anyone else I knew. His sister, my Aunt Elizabeth who was fondly called Lizzie, was the most different female I had ever met. Both of them had different vocabularies than most of our kinfolks, and I never discovered why they talked so differently from anyone else in the family. My sister and I called her Aunt Lizzie. For one thing, she was very thin, and she wouldn’t touch a doorknob. If she had to open a door she would put her hand behind the apron she wore every day if she was in her own house. He used her apron as a buffer between herself and any germs that might live on the knob of the doors in her own house. , or in my house, if she happened to visit us. Both were slender, ented one or perhaps two rooms from my Dad’s uncle and aunt. They were brother and sister, and neither had ever married. Both were tall and slender and both had absolutely marvelous vocabularies. I never saw either of them less than well dressed, and never heard either of them talk with less than a beautiful vocabulary, and a very, very gentile manner. Both were always well dressed, and both were well educated. one, or perhaps two rooms from my Uncle Edward and Aunt Elizabeth Yandle, who lived directly across the street from the duplex my parents pointed out to me as the place our family lived in when I was born. Every time we visited my Aunt and Uncle they mentioned that we had once lived in that house. Uncle Edward and Aunt Elizabeth were, so far as I was concerned when I was very young, among the oddest sort of persons I had ever met. Today I would describe them as having been a little eccentric, but when I was a child, I thought there probably were not any other people in the entire world quite as odd as Uncle Edward and Aunt Elizabeth. </p><p>First off, they were brother and sister, and neither ever married. They shared a nice house, and the house itself was interesting to me. For one thing, it had both electric lights and gas lights. Why it had both I never actually learned. However, there was a fireplace in every downstairs room, and above the mantel there were gas lights in every room, and the stove in the kitchen was a gas stove. In the center of every ceiling in the house there was also an electric cord dangling with a light bulb at the end of it. Remember that these were the 1930’s and though Charlotte had both electricity and gas lines, street cars, and telephones, people who lived on farms a few miles from Charlotte did not yet have either running water or electricity in their homes. Both families used kerosene lamps after sun down, and both cooked on very large black wood stoves, not just in the winter, but all year. When it was cool or down-right cold, the kitchen was usually the warmest room in the house, because the fire in the kitchen stove was rarely allowed to go out. In summer cooking real meals could make the kitchen a miserable hot box, even with all the windows open. In really cold weather the big iron kitchen stove usually kept that room quite cozy and warm. In most country homes during the winter the fires usually didn’t go out, and instead were banked with ashes and rekindled in the morning. never actually died, but they were usually banked at night, which was a simple process of adding firewood, but covering the old red hot coals as well as when they had burned down to mere red coals, they were given more fuel, but were completely covered with cool ashes which prevented oxygen from reaching the coals. Simply removing the ashes and allowing the coals to and thereby prevented the fire from igniting the new fuel. Beneath the ashes the fire did not go out, nor did it flare up—it waited until it there was a source of oxygen, and then it rekindled itself burning the wood placed to prevent the fire from building up to a temperature that would cause wood to burst into to feeding the . instances the During the winter stoves were rarely allowed to truly extinguish the flames all together, and were seldom allowed to actually . Even to burn itself out, in winter as it was not only a cook stove, but the source for warming the kitchen and eating area of most country houses it was important to keep the fire burning throughout the day and into the evening. Near bedtime the stoves were usually “banked” which was simply covering the living fire with cooled ashes, hoping that the living fire would smolder beneath the ashes all night and that when morning arrived a few shreds of wood and a bran , though when morning came again the fire was expected to take up hoping that red coals would still be hot enough to start the fire again when early morning chores were began morning otally Most of the old black iron stoves had a reservoir at one end—which was simply a not very large tank (maybe holding three or perhaps even five gallons) because the stove would increase the temperature in the already hot kitchen making the process of cooking during the summer a miserably hot chore. It was especially difficult Some folk built a separate small building as a summer kitchen to prevent heating up the house for several hours in order to cook meals; however, my farmer kinfolks didn’t let a little heat bother them, and at least once every day they cooked a substantial meal even in the summer. . neither of my grandparents followed that Many in the middle of the day, or in the late afternoon a truly miserable time of dayOnly in the very warm summer did the fire actually go out during the day. . and though the chairs were usually the ordinary straight chairs used around the kitchen table people didn’t complain because they had “only” a straight chair to sit in. erefore the most comfortable room in the house. Rooms not in daily use, such as parlors or unused bed rooms d just for sleeping were rarely kept warm in winter in houses heated only by fireplaces. It was unsafe to leave most warm and comfortable room That made the kitchen extremely warm in summer, though it was wonderfully cozy in the winter. though my Mother’s older sister sometimes didn’t bother to use her stove on Sunday evenings if she was only cooking soup. There was a big hook that could be swung directly over the fire in the sitting room fireplace, and the same fire that warmed the room would warm the soup. Then Aunt Ola would dip out soup, and we would sit around the room and carefully spoon our soup into our mouths while the fire crackled and made us warm outside, and the soup warmed us all from the inside. </p><p>There was a very large arm her soup instead of taking the trouble to build another fire in the big black stove in the kitchen. If it was really cold, and our family was going to eat with them, we would not eat at the kitchen table, but sit in straight chairs in the sitting room and hold our bowls carefully because since no fire was built in the kitchen, it was warmer in the sitting room. sat in the sitting room that was between the kitchen and the bedroom Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance used. When I was very young, theshe hung a large black pot over the fire in the , because of my grandparentsThe parents of both my Dad and my Mother, both of whom lived south of Charlotte near the town of Pineville drew their water from either wells or springs, warmed their houses in winter with fire places in central rooms, and worked their farms with mule or horse drawn equipment. Their cooking was either in a pot hung over a wood fire in a fire place, or on top of, or in the oven of, a wood burning stove. The kitchen stove of usually kept the kitchen much warmer than the outside temperature in both winter and summer. served to warm the kitchen as well as heat a small tank of water, while baking food in the oven, or cooking it on top of the stove. The kitchen stove usually heated the kitchen in winter all through the day, and only in summer was the fire allowed to burn out, because the stove was usually the only access to hot, or even warm water, as all water in the olden days had to be carried into the house in a bucket from a well or a spring unless there was a river near by. a tank at one end to provide hot water, and an oven to a cooked on wood stoves, and went to the drug store, the hardware store, to church, or on a visit, either walked, rode in a buggy, or walked.traveled in buggies. Though the City of Charlotte had telephones before I was born, along with electric trolley cars that, like those still running in San Francisco, were connected to overhead electric lines as their power source, the people living in the countryside a few miles away from large cities still used kerosene lanterns or lamps. Water was drawn from wells or springs, and within Charlotte there were neighborhoods where there was a central pump to supply drinking water for people who lived in houses built so long ago that they had no piping nor indoor facilities like toilets. that were not had no access to rarely had running water inside their homes, nor the luxury of indoor toilets.

Because my Great Aunt Lizzie and her brother, Uncle Edward, lived across the street from that house, I was familiar with the outside of it, but I have no real memory of its interior. </p><p>Our family visited Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward for years, when parking was allowed along East Fifth Street.

My parents had arranged with my older sister to take me out of the house for the afternoon, and to return home with me a day or so before Christmaswhen our family acquired a marvelous home entertainment item that my family called a radio. Radio had been available for several years, of course, but those were “depression days” and only people without children to feed, or with lots of money, could actually own one of those marvelous devices. As the was beginning, and then expanding and growing, and when motion pictures were shown in movie houses there were rules about decency concerning dialog and the poses and clothing of actors and actresses that prohibited nudity, sexual acts, and foul language. Of course, as time passed and movie makers as well as television producers had used up most of their “nice” ideas there were requests to have one “bad” word in a movie, or one glimpse of nearly unclothed performers, and little by little the rules and protocols were stretched to include more and more unpleasant or actually foul language, with less and less decorum where conflicts were portrayed, until eventually decorum diminished until it no longer existed. </p><p>At first only the late night programs allowed the bad words. Then I noticed that some programs no longer hid terrible violence, blasphemy, or foul languages. It no longer mattered what time of day it was, until bad words and hate and sexual conduct was openly shown. The first time I encountered such a program it was about 1:00 A.M. I had worked eight hours, and then left work and went directly to the hospital, though my Mother was comatose and didn’t know I was there. On my way home I stopped at the home in which my Mother and Father-in-law lived, as they both were confined to their beds. They had a care-taker, however, several of the people hired to care for them had proved incompetent, and therefore I checked on them at least once every day. When I left them, I went by the hospital where my mother was a patient, stayed for an hour, and then went home to fix a supper for my husband who worked at night. I usually arrived there in time to make him a meal, pack his lunch box, and see him off to his job, which was from midnight to morning. That night I was later than usual since I had checked on our parents before coming home. After Bobby left for his job I turned on the television set, hoping to find a nice little story that had a happy ending—or something like that.<br/> 99999999999999999999 . in which my mother -my in-lawsat the house my father and mother in-law where both my father-in-law and my mother-in-law were bed ridden—I always checked to be sure their nurse was attending to them. When I arrived home I made and packed my husband’s “lunch” since he worked at night, and kissed him goodnight as he left for his job. Our children were married and had their own homes. I was alone in the house, tired, grieving because I had already done all I could to help those who were ill. I worked during the day, my husband worked every night, our children were married and had their own homes, and heart-sick myself because, though I could and did do my best to help the suffering ones, I could not </p><p>they didn’t among people were forgotten until one night before the turn of the century—still in the late 1990’s, I turned into a late night TV program. I was extremely weary, worried, and deeply sorrowing because there were no cures to be offered, and few effective palliatives for their discomfort. , nothing I could do beyond my Mother, who was in the hospital, was dying and the only thing the hospital could do was keep her drugged. My Mother-in-law was at home, however, she, too, was ill. Within a matter of time I was going to lose both of them. and I loved themin the hospital-in shown on TV, and actually witnessed a performance that included a man having intercourse with a woman, revealing their movements from the waist up and leaving no doubt about the effort it took to achieve their climax. </p><p>“making physical “love” to a woman, leaving very little to the imagination—with movements and gasps and mostly faces—however no one could have and that forbade the reporting of , and children could listen to most of the broadcasts without hearing curse words nor were there even the suggestion of filthy language. or details of sexual . <br/> Not every indulgence is of God, and not all indulgences are good. My Mother told me that I should use the brains the Good Lord gave me, and think through the offerings of the world before making a decision, and always stay away from wrong doing. Because I am not perfect, I’m not certain I did all the things my mother told me to do, nor that I have withdrawn from situations that were not exactly good for me, but I can admit that I tried very hard. </p><p>I suppose I am taking for granted the idea that someone, somewhere, would ever care how I grew up, or how the world looked to me as time passed. My father was born in the Nineteenth Century, my Mother very early in the Twentieth. Their first child was born in 1924, and I was born in 1931. My husband of more than fifty years was born in 1925. My father served in the Merchant Marines in World War I, and my husband served in World War II. Many of my male friends during my teenage and college years served in Korea, and a little later I knew people who went to Vietnam. I was grateful that neither of my children had to serve in any war, however, our first born grandchild did enlist in the Air Force and served for about two years, however, there was no actual war during that time. </p><p>I am very near my seventy sixth birthday, and my husband of more than fifty years is eighty three. We seem to be mostly healthy, and quite mobile; however, neither of us could now manage to dance a jitterbug. We don’t do much running, and we don’t hold paying jobs. We live across the street from Louise and Mike, our daughter and her husband, and five of their nine children. Their first born is married and lives in Oregon with his wife and daughter, and one of their grown-up daughters along with her several pets lives in an apartment three or four miles along with her several pets only a few miles from her parents. only a few miles from us in an apartment, and we see her often.

I have never been mentioned in print except for a small paragraph in The Charlotte Observer when I performed a dance in a kindergarten presentation at the age of five, and again in 1954, because about a week before our wedding I sent a picture of me in my wedding gown to The Charlotte Observer, along with a short blurb about the wedding. The picture appeared in the Sunday edition of the paper the day after the wedding. That has been the extent of the publicity about my life. </p><p>Of course, in my long life amazing events have occurred, and of course many wonderful, frightening, exciting, and a few foolish things, as well, but then I comfort myself by admitting that no one is perfect, and lots of people live through mistakes. </p><p>From the time of my birth our close family was made up of only Mother, Daddy, older Sister and me, though there were lots of uncles, aunts, grandparents, cousins, and of course, after my sister and I married, there were our children. My Sister and her husband, Harry, had four children, two of whom married and both of them have children two children, each. My husband and I have both a daughter and a son. Our daughter married, and over the years she and her husband birthed or adopted children. There are six born children and three adopted children. The oldest adopted child was born with cerebral palsy, and spoke no English when he arrived home. He was immediately placed in school; however, language was difficult for him, as he didn’t realize for several long years that he could learn if he wanted to learn. By the time he realized he really could learn to do things, his school years were over. That young man goes to work at a sheltered workshop five days of each week, and has missed work for only two reasons. His trip to Disney World in Florida, and </p><p>only . He is paid a stipend, which is banked for him, and is accessible for his needs for clothing or special items. One of the most wonderful events in his life was the year his oldest brother planned a surprise for him. Roberto had already graduated from High School, and was working full time at a sheltered workshop. One Sunday morning the family went to church as usual, and after the morning service Roberto discovered that his oldest brother had rented an automobile—a snazzy red car—and his parents had packed clothing and toiletries for Roberto. Kenneth had made reservations at Disney World in Florida for both of them, and Kenneth and Roberto rode the rides, and visited the shows, and looked, and enjoyed the sights and the presentations in theatres, and the meals and seeing Mickey Mouse, and whirling and bouncing and swinging and eating special foods, served by fancy waiters. They both had a wonderful time. and in taking rides on the His brother Kenneth went to church, and when the morning service was over, his elder brother drove up to the church in a rented automobile, loaded with baggage containing a week’s worth of clothes for Roberto, is handicapped, and had very close to no training until he arrived in the United States. He attended school, however he knew no English when he arrived, and didn’t realize he could learn how to read, and therefore graduated from high school, however, he canTwo of the adopted children wanted a lot of children, and so our daughter birthed two children, adopted a little girl, and had another girl child, then a little later she had another oldest child birthed a bunch and adopted some, and has those two young couples had a lot of children. Our daughter and her husband cheated a little, and adopted childrenas she had four children, and has four grandchildren. As time went on, our children married and had children, and sadly we had to attend funerals for the older folk in our family. Even so, through thick and thin, good times and not so good times, my husband and I, who had only two children, now have fourteen grandchildren, three nieces and one nephew, and, recently we counted four great-grandchildren. We, ourselves are now elderly; our son is 48 years old, our daughter 51 years old. My sister, is seven years older than me, and is now a widow. My sister was named for both her grandmothers, and to prevent dismay at the dropping of either one of her names, the family has always called her by both names: Ella Cornelia—five syllables. I, too, have two names, however, had it have turned out that I was a boy, my mother had decided to name me James, and planned to call me Jimmy. </p><p>I have seldom been called Iris Jean, at least not since I was three or four years old, though my sister was always called by all six syllables of her double name. There was one cousin, almost as old as my sister, who gave her a nickname: “Corney” short for Cornelia. I thought that was neat, but no one else in the family agreed, and because of my early training in speaking her name, though I have almost reached my seventy-sixth birthday, I still call her by every clear syllable. When she reached high school her fellow students and teachers found her entire name a problem, and often shortened it. However at home and among kinfolk, she was still called her full name. Only her fellow students made up a shorter name for her. She answered to Ellie, Ella, or only Cornelia. After she was married and had children, The one that was eventually used most often by fellow workers and neighbors was Ella. </p><p>As in most families, names often were slightly altered to lessen the length of long names, or to make pronunciation easier, so that boys called James were often called Jimmy, and girls named Virginia were called Ginny. Since my name used only one syllable I didn’t have a problem. Even so, my mother had several names for me while I was still living at home. As an infant, I think she tried to give me my full name: Iris Jean. Then there was a catastrophe in our family, and I was no longer the center of attention and care.</p><p>Those who were born after 1945 will wonder both how and why such a thing as Poliomyelitis, or tuberculosis, or Infantile Paralysis, or even an infected cut could possibly do the damage it actually caused to the people stricken with the disease or injury before there were antibiotics. Medicines that actually cured illnesses did not always exist. Hospitals gave pills and potions to patients, and used pain killers and put people to sleep for surgeries and the setting of broken limbs, but when I was a child, and when World War II began, Sulfa was about the only medicine available, and that didn’t work on every illness. Surgeries and knowledge was not as great as it is today. My Dad’s sister, Helen, had a problem. Her doctor diagnosed her illness, and decided she needed some substance that was not actually a medicine, and therefore he made up his own concoction. I took the enamel off her teeth, and before she was twenty years old Aunt Helen had to have her teeth—every one of them—pulled. She wore false teeth from her twentieth year. I, myself, have seen huge changes in physical care by doctors and dentists. As a child The physicians of those days tried to help the sick, however, they had very little to work with. Surgeries were </p><p>Of course we had a few pain-killers, and vitamins and minerals, there was alcohol to cleanse wounds, and a number of palliatives that worked; however, there were few injections that would prevent illnesses, and no student could enter school without a small pox vaccination. In some parts of the world contagious diseases were rampart, and leprosy could not be cured anywhere on earth, and neither could tuberculosis. Women all over the world continued to die during childbirth, an most families, even today, can remember stories of families where one man would have married four or five women because four of the them died in childbirth. that about two generations back there would be members of a family who married three or four times, not because of divorce, but because the wife and mother died in childbirth, and the husband married again. there was no people were without the knowledge or a method were required before a child could enter school, and there were other injections that were meant to provide immunity to common illnesses. no wide spread usage of injections were no actual antibiotics, and diseases such as chicken pox, measles, mumps, coughs—and dreadful, terrible, Tuberculosis—as well other frightening and sometimes fatal illnesses killed and . Children who contracted measles and chicken pox, and several other “children’s diseases” were quarantined. They could not leave their homes until they were well, and could no longer pass the disease to other children or adults. A very noticeable pasteboard placard was nailed to the wall beside the front door warning all who approached the door that there was a contagious illness within that home, so that vulnerable persons could avoid the risk catching that disease. </p><p>The illnesses that were common, and usually didn’t cause much damage nor last very long were not subject to notification in such a prominent way as a colorful notice beside the front door. There was no warning on the door when my sister, at about the age of ten, in about 1932 or 1933, became extremely ill. Our mother blamed the illness on intense exertion when playing games with schoolmates. </p><p>In those days when there was no television, and few radios, children actually went out into the yard and played together. Schools, particularly, encouraged students to be active during recess, making it likely the children would be quieter and likely to actually listen to the teacher after a strenuous play time. Teachers in charge of school playgrounds urged the children to play team games, to allow as many students as possible to move around during recess and be tired enough to sit down and listen to the teacher when they returned to the school room. It usually worked pretty well, and the students usually enjoyed playing the games together. </p><p>One day the teacher of my sister’s class handed her female students a long jump rope, and they went outside to play during recess. The girls in the class enjoyed playing jump rope, which wasn’t a complicated game, however it did command very careful movements, rhythm, and stamina to win, and win again. The game usually began by choosing sides, so that one team would be the jumpers, and the other team would provide the strong arms of the rope turners. When a jumper touched the rope, she had to step aside leaving her teammates. When all of one team had stepped aside two people in that group would become turners of the rope, and the other group would become the jumpers. However, if the last jumper could manage to jump ten turn</p><p>It is only a child’s game. There were no prizes for the winning group, and no disgrace for the losing group. However it did keep students moving so that when they returned to their desks they would probably enjoy sitting down, at least for a little while, and could complete their assignments without being fidgety. Since I was only about three years old at the time, I don’t really know what the temperature was that day, nor did I ever learn how many children were playing that game of jump rope. I was far too young to realize either the difficulty that faced my entire family nor the seriousness of the illness that struck my sister after that strenuous game of jump rope. truly pleased with herself. g , so it didn’t It it would be the other team’s time to become jumpers, and the losing team’s tityime to turn the rope. </p><p>On that long ago day my sister was in the jumping group. The rules were, that when only one member of a team was still jumping, she could restore her group as jumpers instead of their becoming the rope turners if—and it was a big if—the last jumper still jumping in the game could successfully jump ten turns of the rope alone without touching the rope. For such a wonderful performance, her entire group could rejoin her as jumpers, and jump until they again touched the rope. There was no limit to the number of times the last jumper of the team could jump ten turns of the rope, keeping his team in place to jump. That day my sister’s group was the jumping group. Of course, even very good jumpers would eventually stumble, and the other team could have a chance at jumping the rope. However, that day didn’t turn out that way. My sister was a determined person, and she was a pretty good athlete. When her first team began to dwindle she didn’t worry, because she was very good at jumping, and eventually she was the last jumper, so she jumped ten turns of the rope by herself, and won another chance for her team. Her team rejoined her, and the game continued. There were no rest periods except those imposed when jumping teams changed from jumpers to rope turners for the other group. </p><p>So she was the last surviving jumper in her group, , instead of becoming the turners of the rope, and the spectators of what the other team could manage to achieve. that would allow his team to start over again. and f only one jumper was left when a bunch of them had stood in a line and jumped the rope together without touching itiIf the jumpers were touched by the rope, they had to leave the game. If all except one jumper had been touched by the rope and had left the game, leaving only one jumper still eligible to jump, the rope turners would count the jumps, and if the single jumper could jump ten times without touching the rope, his entire team could return to the game, and the would still be jumpers, and the onlookers would hope that pretty soon they could become the jumpers, and the The group was usually divided into two teams. One team became an audience, and the other team would try to jump a moving rope without touching it. Touch the rope, and you must stand aside and become an on-looker. When only one jumper has not touched the rope the one jumper can redeem his team, and start the game all over again by dodging the rope for ten swoops. Then the game begins, with the same group of jumpers still jumping, and the same crew would swing the rope again, hoping the entire group will be hit by the rope of the rope. However, the person who of jumpers by jumping the rope ten times without touching it. Then the entire group can join the jumpers and jump until . . Usually two students turned the rope, and half of the remaining students other students who wanted to play began to jump the rope as it hit the ground, trying not to touch the rope with hands or feet, while a half of their number became spectators. elected or volunteering students would stand as far apart as possible with the rope loosely stretched between them, allowing the middle of the rope to touch the ground for several feet. Jumpers could actually line up, and when the rope was lifted and Then the chosen jumpers would either stand by the rope until it swung over their heads and then when the rope touched the ground on the other side of them touched the ground again at two holding the rope would begin to swing the ends of the rope in a circle that reached above their heads, but touched the ground for several feet, and one strong armed were divided into two teams. One team would provide rotating players to turn the rope, and the other team would, as a group, stand in a line and try to jump over the rope as it swept the ground under their feet, and the and then whirled over their heads, descending until the rope again swept under their feet. in an and again sweeping under their feet, then rising up and under their jumping feet. My sister was one of the jumpers. As the rope swished over their heads and swept downward the slip under their feet, one by one the jumpers made the error of touching the rope, or the allowing the rope to touch them. Once touched by the rope the jumper became a spectator instead of a jumper. However if the last jumper could, all by herself, jump ten turns of the rope without its touching her, her team of jumpers could rejoin her as a jumper. She had won reinstatement for her team. jumpers were touched by the rope, they had to leave the game, diminishing the number of jumpers. When only one jumper was left, she could, if she had the stamina, jump ten turns of the rope, and her teammates could join her again as jumpers. If the last jumper failed to jump ten times, the jumpers took over the chore of turning the rope, and the other team, which had mostly been watching the game, became the jumpers. </p><p>999999999999999999999999999</p><p>If er they became the rope turners and spectators, while the other team with its rope turners became jumpers, it gave the jumpers a break and the waiting team a chance to jump. However, there was a way for the very last jumper in the team to “win” another chance for her team, by jumping ten turns of the rope without touching it, and redeeming all of her team mates allowing them to rejoin the game. Ella Cornelia on that day was the champion jumper. </p><p>Her team jumped rope for ten games. Most of her team mates, had the opportunity to rest a little, however, my sister was the one who jumped ten turns of the rope when she alone was the only one on her team so that most of her team had some short stretches of rest while Ella Cornelia single handedly jumped to ten between each of ten separate games. She had no rest, s team were the jumpers, and she jumped every turn of the rope until she was the only jumper left, then she jumped ten times without touching the rope and won the return of all of her team mates. However, she could not rest, as she had to be part of her team when they began to jump again. Ella Cornelia was very proud of herself that day. She was the teammate who jumped ten times so that her team could continue to jump, instead of just turning the rope. Though her teammates touched the rope, she, alone, jumped ten games, and jumped ten turns ten times, every game, jumping ten turns of the rope Her team </p><p>T</p><p>except one jumper had been touched by the rope, that probably tired jumper had the option of jumping ten turns of the rope without touching it, and “winning” her team back as jumpers. Otherwise, the other team would become the jumpers, and the and therefore was out of the game, the last jumper could jump ten turns of the rope, and “win” her team back as jumpers. </p><p>had toand at school was often played by two teams, with as close to an equal number of players as they could manage. One team selected two girls to turn the rope, and their teammates became the spectators. The other team became the jumpers, and all of them lined up to jump the rope at one time. Of course when the team was large the jumpers at either end of the group were at a slight disadvantage, as the turning rope touched the ground in the middle, but was higher from the ground near the turners. Usually the jumpers became tired and touched the rope as it turned, and that team became the rope turners, and the former rope turners became the jumpers. </p><p>On that particular day my sister’s group became the jumpers, and she was in the very middle of the line of jumpers. All of her team-mates touched the rope, however, </p><p>the teams changed places, so that the jumpers became turners, and the turners and their team mates became jumpers.</p><p>One day at school my sister played that game. Her “team” was first to jump. And she was </p><p>and the other team became the jumpers. The teammates of the rope turners became the spectators. The team that was to jump took their place, and tried not to touch the whirling rope, as the jumpers were “out” of the game if they were touched by the rope. Lots of people on the same team usually lost the clumsy jumpers quickly, and eventually most of the jumpers became tired, and touched the rope. However, if only one team member was left, that jumper could jump ten turns of the rope, and thereby win the right to invite all his teammates to rejoin him as jumpers. It was great fun for the winning group keep jumping, keeping the other team standing there watching. When all of the jumpers had jumper was left and </p><p>their other teammates watched the game. The second team, all at one time, lined up and all jumped the turning rope at the same time. However, any jumper who touched the rope was out of the game, which eventually reduced the jumpers to only one which had not been touched by the rope. If that, by now very tired jumper, could jump ten turns of the rope without touching it, she won the continuation of her team as the jumpers, and all of that team could return to the game as jumpers. leaving her teammates to continue the game. When all the jumpers had touched the rope, the teams changed places, and the rope turning team became the jumpers, and the girls who had been jumpers became the rope turners with her teammates forming the audience. only one jumper was left, that girl, if she was not too tired, could jump ten turns of the rope without touching, and win back her entire team of jumpers to try again. </p><p>teams jumpers for another she could bring her team back into complete action by jumping ten turns of the rope without touching it.

Jumpers touched by the rope were out of the game. However, when the next to the last jumper had to step out of the game, leaving only one jumper, if that remaining jumper could jump ten turns of the rope without touching it, her team could return to jump with her, and that meant that there was a team of jumpers who had not yet had the opportunity to jump. that girl cwere out of the game when they touched the whirling rope. My sister was quite athletic, and on that warm day she was in the group of girls who were jumpers while members of the opposite team turned the rope and watched the jumpers to report any contact with the rope. Touching the rope The game had rules. If the jumping team was left with only one . producof a rope turned by two girls on the other team. Even group jump rope had rules. One team selected rope turners, and the other team—the entire team—fell in line between the two rope turners and jumped at the same time. A jumper touched by the rope was out of the game. When all the jumpers were out of the game, as it turned, or stepping on the rope, was out of the game. When only one jumper was left, she could, if she was not too tired, or thirsty, jump ten turns of the rope without touching it, and her entire team could return to the game, and all of them could resume the game. there was Touching the rope while jumping </p><p>so very young, I don’t know which house my parents lived in, or which school my sister was attending. when my sister became illyear, and schools and governments were affected by the Depression as well as all working people all over our nation.

I was too young at that time to put the syllables together to actually name the illness, but it affected both her lungs and her heart. </p><p>When Ella Cornelia was quite young as the youngest also the most important child in the family. I was, for the most part, a healthy child. I am sure I had the normal and expected illnesses of any child, but my illnesses were always ordinary, more than likely my sister had suffered them also because she was the oldest, and I was a normal, healthy child. I, of course, was still a very small child when my sister was suddenly so ill that four well known doctors in Charlotte told my parents she would not recover, she would die. There was no hope of recovery. </p><p>Only one of the five doctors who examined her said she could live, though she might be frail fro a while. He believed she would live and not die.</p><p>The doctor’s name was John R. Ashe. And Dr. Ashe was correct. He did not give up, and kept treating my sister with strength and courage and after a time my sister did begin to mend from the attack of pleurisy as well as another illness, the name of which I cannot remember because I was only a few months older than two years at the time, and because I was so young, it was seldom discussed in my presence. By the time I might have understood the illness, my sister disliked hearing about that part of her life so that it was seldom discussed within the family. Though she lived as if she were strong and healthy she was not really either totally strong nor was she totally healthy and immune to ordinary aches, pains, and illnesses. Even so, she fought being treated as an invalid, or as one susceptible to illness, despite being actually vulnerable to whatever illness popped up in her school or within the group of children she played with. Nothing made my sister angrier than a warning aimed at curtaining my sister’s play time because someone else was ill. </p><p>While Ella Cornelia was ill, and during her recovery, I was actually quiet healthy. Because I was healthy, and my sister needed constant nursing and attention, I needed only to be fed, kept clean, and put to bed on time in the evening, and therefore did not need my mother as much as my sister did. I was farmed out, mostly to my mother’s sister, Ola Davis, who had no children of her own. However, as the oldest child, she had helped raise her three siblings, and had also taken care of a wheelchair bound cousin who had survived Poliomyelitis, a crippling disease. My mother felt I would be safe with Aunt Ola while she gave all her attention to Ella Cornelia who had been diagnosed with two diseases that, in that day and time when there were no actual antibiotics and few palliative medications. Both her heart and her lungs were involved, and four well known physicians told my parents she would die because there was no cure, no medicines, and she was very ill. There was one physician who was a pediatrician in the early 1930’s, and who had two children of his own. Our mother was fighting for her child with all her faith, all her energy, and all her courage, as was our father. Dr. Ashe said she could get well. She could live. And my parents believed him. </p><p>It was not an easy process. She was in the hospital a very long time. When she was allowed to return home, she was forbidden to walk at all. She lived in a wheel chair for months. She missed a year of school, though she could do some studying at home. She was not allowed to walk across a room. She could not be left alone since she was forbidden to move very much at all. In this day and time a person in such straits could at least turn on the television and see what was happening in the world. Our family didn’t even have a radio. She could read, but actually reading had never appealed to her as a rich way to spend a boring day. Think, too, that this was early in our nation’s recovery from the Great Depression. Hospitals, medicines, medical appointments were certainly not as expensive as they are today—but they were not by any stretch of the imagination free. My Dad had become a paint contractor when he lost his job at a lumber yard which closed when no one could build houses or anything else, nor could builders pay for the lumber they had already used to make houses not yet sold. Nothing could be borrowed from banks—they had failed. Banks simply closed their doors. </p><p>Of course, some people did have money to live on. Some home owners who were not actually buying their houses by monthly payments didn’t have the problem. However men and women who had lost their jobs did not get paid, nor were there job openings when stores closed or the businesses stopped doing business because no one could pay them. Had most people been frugal and saved money for a rainy day? Of course many had been that wise; however, the banks were also struck by the shortage of business, and once a crowd of their depositors took out all of the money they had on hand, the banks had to close their doors. They no longer had money to hand out, even if it was owed. If a store or business closed, the people who worked there were out of a job. If a business stopped doing business, no salaries were paid, and no one could afford to buy much of anything in the way of groceries, clothing, medicines, or any other absolutely necessary commodities. Families who had bought a home to shelter their families, and were making steady payments each month, discovered they could no longer make the payments, and therefore they had broken their commitment and could be ordered to leave the property as they had defaulted on the payments. 999999999999999999999999999999999 , homeowners had lost their incomes, could not pay rent and were bumped out of their houses, had had no problems they pay for the lumber and nails and roofing they had delivered just before the when the Depression hit Charlotte and affected almost every sort of business. The lumber yard closed, and therefore he had no job. He had not trained in any way to be a painter, but he borrowed two-by-fours from his former boss at the lumber yard, and built himself a ladder, bought a brush on credit along with a bucket of paint, and went to work as a paint contractor. That was the business he worked with until he retired. . , and neither were hospitals. My parents were renting a wheel chair, which my sister hated. </p><p>there was hope was no novice where child care was concerned. , though she had helped and was well taken care of,</p><p>the youngest, and When I was very small I was called Jimmie upon occasion, as a nick-name. I could never figure out why they occasionally called me Jimmie. Then it dawned upon me that since my parents already had a girl child, they had wanted the second child to be a boy. That meant that my birth, since I was only a girl instead of a boy, I disappointed them—that I, being a girl, was less welcome in the family. I assumed that I was a disappointment since I turned out to be female that they didn’t even want to try again. </p><p>In those days, and before them, there were many people who never, ever admitted that a child was on the way. It was believed that small children should not be bothered with that knowledge lest they learn too early the exact processes of producing children. When observant children remembered physical changes of pregnancy they were not so surprised at the result, but my sister had not noticed how “fat” mother was, and she had a very unexpected introduction to her sibling, after a little more than six full years of being the only child. She was also the only grandchild in the Yandle family, and the first grandchild in the Parks 999999999999999999999999999</p><p>, as well as the only grandchild in the Yandle family, and held the position of being the first grandchild in the Parks family, as well as the first child in her immediate family. She had also been the first grandchild in the Yandle and the Parks families. been, when she had been not only the only child, but the only grandchild in the Yandle family, and the oldest grandchild in the Parks family. In those days when the Depression was a heavy burden in the South the cousins, who lived in South Carolina, rarely visited their grandparents. Therefore, they were not much of a threat to the standing of Ella Cornelia within her close family. She was important as the only child, the only grandchild in the Yandle family, and though not the only child in the Parks family, she was the very first grandchild, and her cousins were much younger than she, so that she was still in an enviable position. </p><p>in the Parks family. e , not only as the and Queen , and therefore didn’t seem to be a problem even though I was female, they could at least call me Jimmie. Both my paternal and maternal grandparents were living when I was born, and I had the pleasure and the privilege of knowing all four of them when I was young. As we were growing up my sister and I had two sets of Grandparents. Our Mother’s parents had the surname of Parks, and our Dad’s kinfolk had the surname of Yandle. I, of course, have no idea where either of those names originated. My forebears may have been among the people who, at one period of time, left Scotland to live in Ireland, or were simply from England, before they migrated to America. </p><p>I, my young self as I was growing up, was aware of only three generations of our family—my sister and me, with our parents and the parents of both our mother, and our father. Our parents had brothers and sisters, and a few of them married and some had children so that we had cousins, too. Most of our close kin lived within fifty miles of our house, though of course there were a few not so close kinfolks who lived in other states. The far away kinfolks were seldom seen and rarely visited, not because we didn’t want to see them, but because my sister I, and our parents, as well as our grandparents were born without those silver spoons. I do mean there were no fortunes to spread out, as every generation had to work, and work hard, to earn a living Our great-grandparents had come from England in the 1800’s and my great grandfather ran a grocery store during the War Between the States, otherwise known as the Civil War. When he came to the United States he was one among a very large group of Yandles and Johnstons. A search for ancestors showed that a very large group—twenty or thirty people at least—almost all with one of two last names. Most of them were either Yandles, or Johnstons. When I saw a list of names of a long list of Yandles and Johnstons, I discovered that most of the Johnstons women had married Yandle men, and Most of the Johnston men had married Yandle Women. My Great Grandfather was a Yandle, who married a Johnston wife, and when she died young, he married a Johnston wife. Grandfather and his second wife celebrated their Fiftith wedding anniversary when my father was a young lad. It was a grand occasion, and he had a special reason for remembering it so very vividly. </p><p>My dad and all the youths who were still considered “children” were warned that since there was only one dining table available, the special meal would have to be served one table at a time, with guests taking turns according to age. Therefore the young boys would be last at the table.<br/> There was a table-full of boys who thought poorly of that announcement. Realizing it would be a long hungering time until they could be fed, they thought up a way to make the time go faster. One of the brave youngsters swiped a cigar from a very large box of cigars given to Grandfather as a 50th wedding anniversary celebration present. They had some matches, too. Behind the barn where they could not be seen from the house, they lit the cigar, and took turns puffing on it. None of the boys had ever before tried smoking. At that time there were not many regulatory rules on how potent the tobacco could be in the smokes, and by the time they had smoked it down to a very short stub, every boy who had puffed the cigar felt sick on his stomach. And just as they began to feel nauseous they were finally called to the banquet table. The women who had made the meal, and who served the meal were puzzled that the boys only picked at their food, and actually didn’t eat very much. However, they were too tired to make a fuss about the uneaten meal, and they simply cleared the table and washed the dishes, very happy to be finished with serving dinner to a large crowd of people. Daddy told that story to us at home, many years latter. He laughed when he told about himself and the other boys, but he wasn’t laughing when he couldn’t eat his meal. He had always loved eating—and he ate a lot. Since tobacco made him sick, so far as I know, he never smoked another cigar or cigarette in his life, and wouldn’t stay in a room with smokers if he could help it. </p><p>Another thing my Dad did not do was drink alcoholic beverages. He told me that he wasn’t old enough to drink liquor. The first time he said that to me I was about six years old. He said it year after year, and he never got old enough to indulge in alcohol. </p><p>ided to go out into the pasture in the shade of the barn and try out something they had never had the opportunity to do before. Gifts, of course, had been brought to the couple who had been married fifty years. One of the gifts was a large box of Cigars. The boys decided that one cigar would never be missed, and none of them had ever tried one. They took only one cigar, </p><p>older guests would eat first, his young cousins, and other young persons who had been invited to the Golden Wedding celebration, were warned that, since there was only one dining table, the guests at on that wondrous occasion so well attended occasion could not eat at the same time, and all would be served one table full at the time. The children were, of course, last. A bunch of boys close to my Dad’s age at that time were keeping each other company, and all of them had been warned to be on their best—their very best—behavior. They endeavored to accommodate their parents; however, they were hungry, tired of waiting, and bored while their all their elders took turns at the table for the exciting and generous meal. Among the visitors there were a number of boys about my Dad’s age, and they were among the youngest guests and would be fed last, and were bored. That was, for the boys, a real Bummer! While they were waiting, there was nothing much to do, and so they walked out behind the barn and concocted a new and wonderful idea. Their grandfather had received a marvelous gift the boys had noticed. It was a big box of cigars. Hungry boys had to do—really do—something. One of them went back to the house to purloin one cigar from the big box that had been Grandfather’s anniversary present. The boys had matches, and decided to light up the cigar and take turns smoking it. So they did. A little while after that they were called into supper. The servers could not believe their eyes when the boys, each and every one, ate so very lightly, not asking for more food, and not even eating all on their plates. None of them seemed hungry. It was a mystery to the cooks and servers. The boys, hungry, forced to wait until later, went out behind the barn where it was shady, and decided that simply waiting and talking was far too dull, especially as they had been waiting to be called to the table for hours. One of the boys had strolled through a room where some Fiftieth Wedding as there was only one table. Everyone would eat according to age and stamina, and the young children would be last. My Daddy was one of the last. There were a bunch of boys about his age, and they were bored since they were in their best clothes they couldn’t do daring tricks </p><p>’s wifeof those kin folk I found thatabout that group It would be confusing only the name of Yandle, or Johnston. Yandle’s had married Johnston’s and Johnston’s had married Yandles, and I was a bit confused to see that some Yandles had married Yandles, and some Johnstons had married Johnstons, thou that may have that I wonder how in the world they ever kept everybody straight. While going through information about them, I found that Johnston’s had married Johnston’s and Yandles had married Yandles, and that, too, struck me as odd. I wondered how they sorted out all those connections. and Johnstons had married Yandles and they settled in the Carolinas, working for their living, going to church on Sunday, and taking care of their families. Oddly enough, some members of my husband’s family and some members of my family grew up in the same area, and were acquainted with each other, though in my generation my Yandle Grandparents were old, almost never leaving their home. Most of their children, Aunts Helen, Martha, and Pauline, and my Uncle Eddie still lived at home when I was small. My Dad was the only one who was married and living away from the home place. The Home Place was a large two story house with both a front and back porch., in front of the steps in the front of the house was a grassy pathway lined on both sides with daffodils which bloomed every Spring. The front yard was grassy all the way to the ditch that ran along both sides of the highway to catch the rain that fell on the roadway. Close to the road one swath of the yard was the same level as the road, itself. However, about fifteen or twenty feet from the highway there was a slanting hill that was easy to walk up, or down and at the top of that fairly steep bank that was always covered with grass, there was another level of the yard, and for much of the way there was a well-kept level earthen walkway up to the steps, with and on each side of that walkway there were daffodils in the Spring, and little green leaves that stood straight up in rows during most of the rest of the year. All along the upper level of the yard were huge oak trees that shaded the house. 999 The front of the two story house had a large front porch and on it there were rocking chairs and straight chairs for resting, and a nice porch swing at one end of the porch. The famly could sit there in the shade of the marvelous trees that grew around the house, and watch an endless series of trucks, cars, motorcycles, as well as the occasional horse-drawn conveyance or even a pedestrian, move with an even and determined pace along the road. Pineville, on the nearly white cement surface of Pineville Road, with a big black line right down the middle of the road. . move toward either away fromThere was ers and a swing, ready when folks wanted to sit quietly and watch the traffic roll by on the highway. Sitting in the swing you could see all of the front yard, the side yard, part of a pasture, and the acreage my Grandfather owned across the highway which was usually planted with cotton, or corn, and sometimes with vegetables and lovely things like water melons, and sometimes beans and squash and okra and tomatoes. I was only in that field once or twice, because as a little girl I was not allowed to cross the highway without my parents or other adults. Most of the visits were spent in Grandmother’s room, where grown-ups talked and remembered, and discussed what was going on in the world. Though it was Most of the time we visited there my parents spent the afternoon talking with my Grandmother, because she was blind, and bed-ridden. The sitting room of the house had become her bedroom before I was born. During an average day in warm weather she would sit in her rocking chair near a window to eat her meals, and as long as she was comfortable in her chair. When she felt tired, she would go back to bed. Her daughters helped her with washing and dressing, and allowed her to snap beans or do any small chore that didn’t require sight, and that she could do sitting down. , f bed. When she became tired, she lay in her bed. If there was a visitor, or any member of the family to converse with, she would listen to the people who talked to her, and she would talk with them also. She ate in her bedroom her three meals each day, brought to her by one or the other of her oldest two daughters. Grandmother had a rocking chair with a pillow on the seat, and a soft pad that covered the back of the chair, as well. She walked only from her bed to her rocking chair, or from her chair to the bed. She did not go to the table to eat even on special occasions. She literally lived in that room, and left it only once that I was aware of during my childhood. One day my Dad spent the day doing something, probably painting the walls and ceiling of the room, and it was decided that Grandmother should be spared the entire process of painting walls and ceilings as well as window frames and doors, and my Dad and my Uncle Eddie picked up the rocking chair my grandmother usually sat on, and carried her outside the house and across her own yard, a dirt road, and two more back yards into another house rented by Aunt Pauline and her husband. Grandmother then spent a long part of the day in Aunt Pauline’s living room. Aunt Pauline had married a family Henry On Sunday mother and . that ran in front of the house. It was a busy road, and led to York if you kept straight down the highway from the house. However, if you drove only half a mile past the Yandle house, then turned right and kept on going, you would find that the road itself widened for a short distance, making room for cars to park diagonally along the street where there were stores: a drug store, a barber shop, a hardware store, a five and ten cent store owned by Mr. and Mrs. Jaffa, who owned several five and ten cent stores—six or more of them—all over Charlotte and in small towns ten or twenty miles from Charlotte. The road that went straight through the town of Pineville crossed the railroad track, then a little beyond the tracks there was a bridge over a wide creek, and a little bit further from Pineville was the South Carolina line. Not far from the town of Pineville there was a road that stretched into South Carolina, city blockand there were buildings on both side of the street just like uptown Charlotte, with shop windows, a drug store, a bank, an office building, a cotton mill, and the railroad track. Beyond the railroad track there was just road going toward a bridge that extended over a large creek, after which the road continued toward the fairly close South Carolina Line. </p><p>The road through the town of Pineville covered more space than an ordinary road in Charlotte, because cars could park on both sides of the road, and they did not parallel park in Pineville. They parked the cars nose-in to the curb along the sidewalk, , and a little just the was, of course, went straight road </p><p>were still living with them when I was very young. My Dad was the youngest boy of that family, and he had one older brother and two older sisters, and one younger sister, named Pauline, who was the only one of her siblings who completed High School, and went to college. My Dad was born in 1896. I don’t know when the others were born, but Aunt Helen was the oldest girl, and Aunt Pauline was the youngest surviving girl. One day when I was following my Uncle Eddie around the yard of their house he took me into the barn-yard where I discovered a little—a tiny—little boxy tool shed. But near its door there was a stone, and it looked like a grave stone. I examined it and discovered it was a grave stone, with a girl’s first name and the Yandle name engraved on it. It was an extra grave stone for my Dad’s baby sister who died when she was about three years old. I had never before even heard of her. However, years later I saw her grave 999999 nameThere was another little girl who was my Dad’s little sister, who died many years ago when she was about three years old. I had never known she even existed , many years. For some reason there were two gravestones made for her. One of them marks her grave, but there was another that lay on the ground near a small square wooden structure behind my Grandfather’s well house. One day Uncle Eddie allowed me to follow him into the barn yard. He went into a little hut that I hadn’t actually noticed before, as there was a good sized well house beside the well. Connected to the roof of the well house, there was an extension of roof that covered a platform in the middle of which was a box-like shelter about for the well, itsel. There was a box-like cover above the well, with a pulley and chain aboveand above the and a chain well house on the other side of the fence kept it from view. I could see that the interior of that oddly small building standing inside the barn yard if I was in the barn yard, too. The well from which all the water used for either animals or people was drawn from a square well that had a roof over it. I decided that the nearby trees and the roof of the well house helped to keep the water cool, and it probably did do exactly that. The trees offered shade to both the well house and the roofed platform of the well itself. The well-house had a cement floor, and it was cooler there, where there was running water most of the time. I never knew where, or how, there was water in the well housesheltered by the tree than and mostly hidden from view from the yard because it was behind the well house inside the barn yard. , not even as big as our smallest closet at homesmallnarrow and to keep hoes and hatchets for breaking wood for the big black wood burning kitchen stove. There were rakes and other garden tools leaning against the narrow walls of that weather beaten and worn out little shed, but lying on the ground near its open door was a flat stone. It was a grave stone, and was just lying flat on the ground. Of course I asked , was a grave stone, with a name I didn’t know then, and unfortunately don’t remember now. and was put away in a small square shed that was separate form the barn, and I had not even noticed it before that long ago day when I had followed Uncle Eddie beyond the wire fence that served as an entry into the pasture and also the barn. hheld hoes and rakes and shovels and other similar items weather beaten shed that held tools and </p><p>I didn’t realize until I had children of my own how often babies died in the 1800’s and in the early 1900’s.

People are living longer, and are able bodied much healthier for many years than most people were when my grandparents were young. </p><p>I have one Great-Grandchild who was premature, though she is a bright, healthy, and beautiful youngster now in the first grade. Had she been born in the times my uncles and aunts were born, there would not have been the weeks of special treatment in a hospital to help her survive, as none of the medications or breathing devices had been discovered or invented before, and just after the turn of the Twentieth Century. People today take for granted that there is now an easy, if expensive, cure for most of the problems and illnesses of folks from pre-natal up to more than a hundred years, and that there are treatments and protocols that can defeat pain and help to extend lives. In the Twenty-first Century such wonderful relief and curative actions happen everyday in hospitals and doctor’s offices all over our country and in many other parts of the world.</p><p>When my parents were born doctors were handicapped by the lack of knowledge, not because the physicians had not been trained, but because information did not flow across the world as completely or as swiftly as it does today. Antibiotics were not discovered until about the time of the World War II. Sulfa was used in those days, but that was about the extent of it. Information did not travel across oceans and deserts and unoccupied areas of the world, nor were medical discoveries always shared world-wide. </p><p>When the and most of the medicines were not invented until the 1940’s, when communication became tremendously better across both the United States and also in many other nations all over the globe.

Much later I discovered that my grandparents and his grandparents knew each other when they were young. <br/> It was interesting to know that my Aunt and Uncle who lived close to Piineville lived for many years across the road from Bobby’s Uncle, and that they had been friends for years. My Grandmother Yandle mentioned that she had seen my father-in-law when he was an infant, as the two families, both riding in conveyances behind horses had passed each other on the road, and had stopped for several moments to talk with one another. </p><p>Since we both grew up in Charlotte, it seems strange that my husband and I never met each other until I finished College and went to work in the church he and his family attended. However, Charlotte was a big town when I was small.<br/> 99999999999999999999999999999999999999</p><p>rom the town of Pineville, and their house was in a wide space of land between the main highway from Charlotte southward and the railroad tracks that led from Charlotte to Pineville. When my Uncle Edward who was my Dad’s brother, walked to Pineville from the Yandle house, he usually followed the railroad because it was the shortest route to the stores in that small town. During my childhood there were stores in Pineville, however I remember only a drug store, a barber shop, a five and dime store, a post office, and a hardware store. There were others, of course, but not many. The drug store was where my Dad bought his mother’s medicine when he was growing up. Near the little town there was a large house that was the doctor’s house, and it sometimes served as a hospital—a very small one—when the illness did not require aids that only a larger better equipped hospital could provide. I faintly remember that among the businesses in Pineville there was a place where train tickets were sold, though it was not a station where passenger trains stopped every time they passed by. If there were no travelers to either leave the train or join it at the Pineville station, passenger trains didn’t stop. </p><p>As a child I was not often in the town of Pineville, though I visited my Yandle grandparents nearly every Sunday afternoon. When I was very small we also visited my Parks grandparents; however, I was very young when they were still living in their own home, because when I was probably about five years old they moved from their own home into the house owned by my mother’s sister, Ola, and her husband Vance Calhoun Davis. I have three memories of the home place where my Parks grandparents lived, and two of them were when I was very young. The first memory was a walk with my Granddaddy Parks, and during that walk we passed a very little building with no windows, but a narrow sort of door. Granddaddy opened the door and took a bucket full of dried ears of corn, and we went back to the house while he shucked the corn and took the little yellow kernels off the cob and then we went out to feed the chickens. The next memory concerned another day when we visited them, and on that day it was raining. The grownups wanted to talk about important things, and I was politely asked to go out on the porch while they talked. I remember climbing up on a hump-backed trunk that sat against the wall of the house, well away from edge of the porch where raindrops were falling very hard on the tin roof and then running off at the side of the porch. Some of the drops actually hit the edge of the porch, dampening the floor at the edge. My Dad’s car was wet. The steps were wet, too, and the driveway was getting a little muddy. </p><p>On that day I didn’t know that day about a special treat that was going to be offered to me. While my parents and Aunt Ola were making plans to move Grandmother and Granddaddy Parks from their home to Aunt Ola and Uncle Vances house, they were also talking about the fact that once Grandmother and Granddaddy had moved, they wouldn’t need to drive to church behind a horse. They had always driven to church behind a horse—a white one, with black spots on it. After moving in with Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance, they would be able to ride in the car with Uncle Vance driving it whenever they needed to go anywhere. They wouldn’t need their horse and buggy any more. </p><p>Now that sort of shocking change took away from Granddaddy Parks a job he had always done, week in and week out all of their married life. Granddaddy had always taken Grandmother to church in his buggy. They went every Sunday from their home behind Old Pink. And from that time on, they wouldn’t need Pink, nor would they need the buggy. They could ride in Uncle Vance’s 1928 Ford car wherever they needed to go. </p><p>Of course my grandparents had ridden in the car before. But living in Uncle Vance and Aunt Ola’s house they would never, ever again, really need to hitch old Pink to a wagon or buggy to go anywhere, or do anything. Uncle Vance used a tractor in his fields. Though people had been using cars and trucks for a long time, now the modern travel method was intruding into the lives of my Grandparents, and the change was intruding on their very mobility, and on their entire way of life. Their world, not just the house they would be living in, was changing, and because of Grandmother’s health, the change was being thrust on them, and it was a traumatic change for both of them, to give up their own house, their independence, and move into Aunt Ola’s house and thereafter, though they would have their own bedroom, they would be living in Aunt Ola’s house instead of their own.<br/> 88888888888888888888888888888</p><p>their usual The lives . a white horse with black spots named that on a nearby Sunday I would have a really wonderful treat. I was a very young child, but I knew that not everybody owned an automobile. The Great Depression had been very tough on the South, though the brunt of it was delayed somewhat from 1929. Country folks and farmers didn’t rely on banks as completely as did the Northern businesses. However, eventually the closing of businesses in the North began to affect businesses in the South. For one thing, the South was not as “rich” as the North. More people in the South made their living on farms than those in the North, where mills and other industries had flourished before the Wall Street collapse. Think of the actual dates. The SouthAs the 1. It took a little bit longer to strike deep into the South, because the South was mostly farming country, with only a few cotton mills and a few other industries that were actually attached to large businesses. However, into the early 1930’s rather than striking its worst problem in 1929. enough to know that But that was in my future, too. My Daddy had a car. We drove to Pineville from Charlotte often, and on that day we had come to see Grandmother and Granddaddy Parks in our car, but in those days people didn’t move about as they do now. . But we didn’t run about in cars in those days as much as folks do now. </p><p>, and other drops hit the edge of the front porch, splattering the edge of the porch floor, and wetting all of the yard, the top of my Dad’s car, and the leaves on the trees. Each raindrop made it individual silvery splash on the edge of the front porch. </p><p>There wasn’t anything else to see that was extremely riveting. My view was of grass, and trees with wet leaves, the small shelter above the well that was in the front yard not far from the house, and if I turned to one side, I could see a very small little house that looked like a play house, but in the fall it would hold lots of ears of corn. If I looked off to one side and stretched to see beyond the edge of the house, I could see the barn. squenched upHowever, the rain falling on the tin roof above the porch made lot of noise. So I sat for a long time watching the rain, while inside the house the adults talked. Not long after that day I was told that Because not long after that visit I had a wonderful treat, I think the talking the grownups were doing that day was about my grandparents moving from their own house into the home of my Aunt Ola and her husband Vance Davis.</p><p>The nice house my grandparents were moving into was more modern than their own, though drinking water was still brought up hill from the spring in enameled buckets. The spigots in her kitchen were great, because there was a huge tank at the corner of the house that caught rain that ran off the roof of the house and that was piped into the kitchen over the sink. It was good for washing and rinsing things, but not for drinking. Therefore, drinking water was brought still brought from the spring from the spring. Aunt Ola cooked in her old fashioned wood stove in her kitchen for all of her life, but in summer there were a lot of suppers , but there was But there was no running drinking water, nor electricity in Aunt Ola’s house either. The drinking and cooking water came from a spring that was located down a path—and I mean actually down hill from the house, that I, when I was in grammar school, I measured by counting my steps down to the Spring, and up again. I decided that the spring was about three fourths of a city block from the bottom of the back steps to the spring. It was always , and going towards the spring it was down-hill all the way, and that little more than a half of a a city block long. </p><p>Aunt Ola was my mother’s sister. She and Uncle Vance had no children, though they did have a lovely house with six lovely rooms, and porches on both the front and the back. Uncle Vance was very clever in the placement of the house. There was a porch on the front of his house, and anyone entering the front door had to make only one step up onto the porch. There were also comfortable chairs and a swing on the porch. Once a person entered, there was a wide hallway that lead to the back of the house, and if you walked out on the back porch you realized that you had a lot of steps to walk down if you wanted to go into the back yard, because Uncle Vance, instead of digging a basement beneath his house for a machine shop, and repair shed, set the front of his house on the top of a hill, and built the rest of the house over the descending slanted side of the hill, shoring up the few places that needed shoring, and building brick pillars to support the house in every place they were needed. His workshop was sheltered by the house, itself, and along the sides of the house near the front of the house there was a brick foundation.<br/> However, there was a large opening to his basement at the back of the house, letting in light for most of the day. There was also a long set of steps from the very tall back porch to the ground. To a very small child that outdoor staircase was frightening because of its length. I particularly felt uneasy using the back door steps when I was small, partly because the under side of the staircase was open, so that you could see a lot more than just the next step—you could see between the steps precisely how far from the ground you were climbing to reach the solid platform at the top. Once at the top on the platform leading into the house it was not frightening. I remember that when I was very small I preferred walking up hill to the front door rather than climbing those steps. </p><p>If a person of my acquaintance during my childhood had wondered how folks used to live without electricity, I could have said, “come with me to Aunt Ola’s house, or my Grandmother Yandle’s house, and I will show you. My Parks Grandparents had not enjoyed electricity, either, but </p><p>where there were banisters around the porch so no one would just fall over all the way to the ground. , not just the next solid step, but between the risers leading and high set of steps leading to the door of the back porch which was screened in—except the screening was cloth—not ordinary thin wire screening like the screens at our house. When I was a small child each spring brought lots of cloth screening complete opening very near the back door of his house, though he did have to climb steps to his back porch. His back porch was a large outside room with a very good roof, and a half wall that kept out rain. The space above the half wall was screened surrounded the porch was screened in, making a sort of almost outdoor room which could hold the round dinner table in the summer, providing a much cooler dining room since cooking was done on an old fashioned wood stove that added unwelcome heat to the kitchen in summer. On winter days that warmth was truly appreciated, but in summer it was nice to eat on the back porch where any breeze could cool the summer . warmed the kitchen . eating room sinceimbing his back steps allowed him to enter the kitchen of his house, and below his house were a great many of his tools, and a satisfactory work place. were out of the wet, .

It was built by my Uncle Vance who was one of those marvelous people who could turn his hand to a lengthy variety of skills. He was a farmer, an inventor, a skilled innovator, and he ran a home-made lumber mill, took care of his farm, raised chickens and kept cows, planted crops and harvested them. </p><p>My Aunt Ola had several cows, and in those days the government did not require that milk sold to the public had to be pasteurized, so Aunt Ola delivered milk from her cows to lots of people in Pineville. She also sold butter milk and butter, and sometimes also delivered eggs to her steady customers.<br/> to see beyond wet leaves of the trees, nor was there anything interesting to listen to, except the sound of the rain on the tin roof. So I sat on the humped top of the old trunk until the rain stopped bouncing on the edge of the porch, then I stepped into the wet place, and put the print of the wet soles of my shoes on the floor of the porch. However, I couldn’t go into the yard, and I didn’t want to go into the house to sit quietly while the grown-ups talked and did whatever grownups do when they want to discuss something important. </p><p>When the rain eased up I walked along the edge of the porch, daring to step into the wet spots left by the rain, and tracking my footprints on the floor of the porch. </p><p>except the , which, to tell the truth, wasn’t all that comfortable.

The youngest boy died when he was very small, though the four other children grew up strong, good people. Uncle Luther married a lady who taught school in South Carolina, and had lived for all of her life in a house that was built before the War Between the States by her forebears. Our family visited that house only once during my childhood, and my childish memories of that old house were that it needed painting though it looked sturdy enough. There was a pump next to the kitchen sink that provided running water in the kitchen. There was an old fashioned wood burning stove for cooking. It was a two story house with a wide front porch which is where we sat most of the time we were there visiting during that warm day. The yard and porch was shaded by tall trees with long limbs that offered shade all around the house, and especially the front and back porches. Uncle Luther and Aunt ____ had no children. She was a school teacher, and my Uncle Luther also worked for the school system, repairing damaged desks and broken windows, replacing light bulbs and taking care of other similar chores for several schools in that county area. He was well known by the students of several grammar schools in that District because he was the person who fixed most of the break downs in the school system in that area. </p><p>I remember only the one visit to Uncle Luther’s house because it was a long drive to where they lived, though when my sister was in her teens she spent a week with them during the summer.

My mother was the youngest child in her family, however she had two older brothers, and one sister. Her sister was named Ola, Her oldest brother was named Luther. I liked Uncle Luther quite well, but we seldom saw Uncle Luther because he and his wife, Eliza, lived on a farm that had belonged to Aunt Eliza’s family for more than a hundred years. 99999999999999 .

We had lots of kinfolk, and at the same time, had few that were close in age to either my sister or me. My parents lived in Charlotte, North Carolina, and their parents were about ten or twelve miles from Charlotte near the town of Pineville, which was very close to the line that divided North Carolina from South Carolina. </p><p>In an era when people were actually still using horse drawn buggies and wagons for travel—and that period was in the late 1930’s—it was not unusual to see horses in Charlotte, and quite ordinary to see them in the Pineville area. The church where my Parks grandparents worshipped was named Flint Hill Baptist. My parents went there often enough for me to know that My Granddaddy was quite special to the members of the church. Though Grandmother usually sat with my mother’s sister and her husband, my Grandfather sat in a chair facing the congregation a little to one side of the pulpit, because he was a deacon. , and they drove there behind a horse named Pink. Pink was really supposed to be white, but somehow or other his coat was not very heavy, and his pink skin showed through the white coat. Therefore, his name was Pink. </p><p>went in a buggynamed ______Baptist, had a Line. In the early part of my life we spent almost every Sunday afternoon visiting my Dad’s parents, and sometimes we also visited my Mother’s parents, too. My Dad’s parents lived about ten miles away, and my Mother’s folks were about two or three miles further down the road. There is a large mall built where my Parks grandparents once lived, and there is a well known stores famous for building materials where my Yandle grandparents once lived. </p><p>As a child I often visited the homes of my grandparents on both sides of the family.<br/> and often visited my Grandparents on both Mother’s and Daddy’s side of the families, and many of them lived only ten miles from Charlotte. There were my grandparents, along with lots of Aunts and Uncles and cousins that my parents liked to visit, and of course when my family went visiting kinfolks, I went with them most of the time. Both my parents lived in and grew up in the vicinity of Pineville. My mother’s parents were still living, and she had a sister and two brothers, all of whom were married, but only Uncle Dennis Parks who had married Aunt Mary, had children—three of them—two girls and a boy. On my mother’s side of the family, she and her brother Dennis were the only ones who had children, as neither Aunt Ola, her sister, nor their brother Luther was the only one of her siblings who had chiher sister was in easy traveling distance, and on my Dad’s side of the family there were even more people. My Yandle grandparents lived on a farm about a mile from Pineville, and in addition to his parents, he had three sisters and one brother.

Road which I thought was a very wide and nerly white cement highwaywas paved but the road from the highway to their house was mostly red mud)often, and my Dad and his family often talked about their Grandparents—about something they said, and My forebears were, most certainly, brave. Travel in those days—before the Civil War and long after it—was a bit iffy to say the least. Ships were small, powered mostly by sails, and had few conveniences. The people who packed a few clothes and set sail in ships somewhat but not greatly larger than a row boat were tremendously brave and strong, and had not only courage, but stamina also. A largish number of my ancestors came to the United States in the mid 1800’s, and when researched it was discovered that they arrived within a close time frame99999999999 a large number of persons who were surnamed either Yandle or Johnston sailed across the Atlantic and settled somewhere in the new nation of the United States, often times in the same vicinity of Carolinas, and with other members of the family scattering into Philadelphia or California, or other more northern destinations. I remember my Dad talking about his family in the same vicinity, and others who with the same name who settled in other areas of the growing nation. It struck me as unusual to have so many people with the same two names travel from England America at the same time, often on the same ship, either of two names, the Johnston’s and the Yandles, was requested, the number of them was most interesting to me. There were Johnston men whose wives all had the same maiden name: Yandle. There were Yandle men, who’s wives all had the maiden name of Johnston. the list was interesting to me because on that list there were only two surnames. The women who were already married to Johnston men seemed to have only one maiden name which was Yandle. If their maiden name was not Yandle, it was Johnston, and their husbands were Yandles, and vice-versa. Upon a few occasions, Yandles married Yandles, and Johnstons married Johnston. There was a bunch of them who came within a short length of time, or they c mostly farmers, with at least one Great Grandfather who ran a store during the War Between the States. My forbearers were strong people. One of my distant cousins made a search of our forebears, and discovered kinfolks from Philadelphia, California, and both North and South Carolinas. The arrival in the new world of people using two name: Johnston, and Yanele, A search for family was mostly a large one, and there is evidence that two families left England before the Civil War to come to America. There were a number of couples, and a few unmarried grown-ups who, about the same time, came to make their home in America. I found it odd, to some extent, that most, if not all, of that particular group belonged to one of only two surnames. Some of them were single, some of them were married, and though they did not entirely settle in the same part of the United States, many of them began in the Carolinas. Howfamilyose particularthe majority of that particular family had oabout the same time two families had inter-married. There seemed to be a fairly large number of Johnston women who married Yandle men, and also a large number of the Johnston men married Yandle women. Then most of them came to America from England, and scattered all over the new country called the United States. They were mostly well settled all over that young and growing nation, some in Philadelphia, and other points North, and a large group of them in the Carolinas. There were four Yandle brothers, most of whom had married into the Johnston family, and there were also a goodly group of Johnston men who married Yandle ladies. They menfolk had various skills, and some had extensive educations. My Dad often spoke of the beauty of some of the Johnston ladies who were his kin. the South. , upon at least one occasion, a Yandle woman married a Yandle manwho sought education when it was available, and who worked hard, more often than not on a farm, and almost all of whom belonged to either a Baptist or a Methodist Church. Though I believe that many of them were experienced farmers, there were store keepers and mill workers as well. Some were well educated, others had less schooling, but somehow most of the first group of American born youths of the Johnston or Yandle families was determined to attend school whenever possible, and never actually stopped learning and seeking knowledge. I was always surprised at the variety of knowledge my older family members showed as I was growing up, though they kept telling me how fortunate I was to be able to graduate from high school, because most of them had not achieved that goal. For instance, my Dad finished eighth grade, but had to go to work from that time onward, studying on his own when he could. My Dad had three sisters, and one brother, and of the five, only the youngest sister finished high school and went on to college. My Dad was eager for both my sister and me to attend school and, and he also paid for me to attend four years of college. My sister had the opportunity to attend college, and enrolled in a college in Western North Carolina; however, she was not impressed by what she was learning, and returned home with all of her belongings when the College temporarily closed for the Christmas vacation during her first year. Ella Cornelia had worked most of the summers while she was in High School, and she had worked for a while after she graduated from High School. She had not been impressed with her freshman year in college where she, who had gone to school with neighbors for twelve years, having lots of friends, and acquainted with most of her teachers before she actually sat in their classes, found the freshman year with its basic classes boring, and unproductive. So she came home with all her belongings, and brought a schoolmate with her—one who agreed with her completely. That was the end of her college experience. I’m not sure how much school was actually available to my Mother, but she read constantly when she could spare the time. She had, when I was small, always made every stitch of clothes we wore, except Daddy’s shirts and overalls. and Daddy were disappointed, but Ella Cornelia went to work again, and not long after that World War II began and life and the living of it became very different even though we were far from the actual battles. </p><p>all over the world. Before there had been there washad no problem finding a job. however, that was the year that decided that repeating ordinary freshman courses she had touched, however briefly, in High School when college cost so much money She, who had always been surrounded by schoolmates she knew well, was studying things she had already studied in High School and there was not even one old, or new, friend in the whole college whom she really knew, the entire experience seemed a waste of time. known most of her classmates taking courses </p><p>When she left school that Christmas I was in the Seventh Grade, and I was determined that if I, too, had the opportunity, I would go to college, and I would graduate. As we were growing up my sister and I knew what to expect every day of the week. Monday through Friday were work days for our Mother and Dad, and for most of our lives, both of them had jobs. Saturday was wash the clothes day, as well as scrub and mop and dust day, and most of the time it was also change the sheets and iron the clothes that day that you wanted to wear each day of the following week. Sunday morning was church time, and Sunday afternoon was visiting Grandparents day. Because visiting Grandparents was really important to my parents, we didn’t often miss seeing them at least once a week. By the time I was old enough to appreciate the importance of, not only love within our family, but caring, and caring enough to be active in attending and providing the care needed by family members. Both of my parents were had older brothers and sisters, but they did not ever shirk their duties to their parents. </p><p>My Grandparents on both my Mother’s and my Dad’s sides of the family were old when I was a child. Any one could tell that my Yandle Grandparents were obviously old. My Grandmother was blind, and left her bed only to sit in a rocking chair for her meals, unable to do anything for herself, or for anyone else. My Grandfather was also old, and though for some years while I was growing up he continued to go into the fields at sowing and harvest time, he grew less and less able to pick cotton, or vegetables, or to plant and sow in the Spring. Milking and feeding pigs and cows became solely Uncle Edie’s chores, though he was not nearly as strong as my Dad. Often at harvest time my Dad spent several days helping his parents and his brother with the harvest, and later, he often helped with the sowing of seeds in the spring. </p><p>Helping on the family farm took my Dad away from his own business, but he never failed to offer his parents and his brother and sisters the help they needed because farming was not only their food supply, but also their wages that would pay for medicines and doctor visits, as well as foods and clothing that were needed because they couldn’t be, or simply weren’t, grown or produced in their own fields. </p><p>I had been married at least a year when my Dad installed an indoor bathroom at the house his parents had lived in all of my life, and of course, when water was piped into the bathroom, it was piped into the kitchen also, which was a wonderful help to Aunt Helen and Aunt Martha. </p><p>My mother and her family were also farm bred; however, though the parents of my Mother remained farmers, her brothers did not. The oldest brother, Uncle Luther, married the lady who became my Aunt Lisa. For many years Aunt Lisa’s ancestors had lived for a long time in the house she inherited. It had been built before the Civil War began, and it survived the war, and at intervals had been improved, however, though Aunt Lisa’s kitchen had running water, it had to be pumped by hand into the sink in the kitchen. Aunt Lisa was a school teacher, and had lived all her life in that house. She was the only surviving member of her immediate family, and sadly, she and Uncle Luther had no children. Uncle Luther worked for the School Board also, making repairs to a number of local schools, including the one where Aunt Lisa taught. </p><p>I was in my early teens when my Dad took our whole family to visit Uncle Luther and Aunt Lisa. Aunt Lisa was still teaching school at that time, and Uncle Luther was still repairing broken desks, chairs, windows, and other items that young students often broke. He was quite clever with his repairs, and had enjoyed working with wood for most of his life, sometimes simply for his own satisfaction. He repaired the old furniture in Aunt Lisa’s house, and now I have two of the table chairs that Uncle Luther and Aunt Lisa used, though they don’t match. We use them at our table every day, and we enjoy them. </p><p>My mother’s other brother was named Dennis, who was a little bit younger than Uncle Luther. Uncle Dennis had to go into the army during the First World War. Since it was a long time before I was born, I don’t know much about his days in the armed forces, however, I did hear that he was in the trenches in France during the First World War. When he came home, he married Aunt Mary, and they had three children, Dennis Junior, Patsy, and Mary Cole. I liked young Dennis because once when I was about thirteen or fourteen he came to Charlotte and visited for a while at our house. I don’t remember why he made the trip, but he had an appointment to see someone in uptown Charlotte, and I helped him find the right street. He, in turn, bought me lunch, and I felt wonderfully pleased at so grown-up an event. He seemed to enjoy the time he spent with me, too, and I went with him to the bus station and saw him off on his bus. The Bus Station was only about eight blocks from our house, and I knew quite a bit about uptown Charlotte. </p><p>My knowledge of the uptown area grew rather wide when I was about six years old because my Mother, when I was a first grader, took a job in a building only about twenty-five steps from the very center of town that everybody called simply, the Square, now simply an intersection where Tryon Street and Trade Street crossed. Once it was actually the very center of Charlotte, because there was a wooden building right in the center of that intersection which was the Court House for the town which was, I think, first made of logs. That small building was, indeed, the very center of the town. Eventually, of course, the town outgrew the smallish building, and because most of that area already had permanent buildings along the streets, it was eventually decided to erect a City Hall and a Mecklenburg County Courthouse further down East Trade Street, and so they did. In the space where the center of the Court House once stood, a large circular marker was made and placed in the center of the space where the original Courthouse stood that marked the center of city where so many decisions and laws were made when Charlotte was mostly a muddy little town. The last time my husband and I drove through Charlotte, I saw that circular metal marker still embedded in the asphalt of the still very busy intersection.</p><p>I spent part of my childhood very near that marker. On the first day of school when I was beginning my education, I walked alone to the school, two blocks away from my house. I had to cross only one street before I came to an intersection where there was a crossing guard. The street I crossed alone was seldom used because it didn’t lead anywhere important. The street was not actually aligned, as it was wider for a couple of blocks, and extremely narrow at the intersections at both Tryon and Graham Streets. I wasn’t afraid to cross Tenth Street by myself. It was wonderful to realize that there was for many years a policeman at Graham and Ninth Street which made it a lot safer to cross that busy thoroughfare. And so I learned to depend on myself when I walked to school. </p><p>On my first day of school it was a first day for my mother, as well. She was going into business in a shop with her friend Mrs. King, and when school was out I was going to walk almost twelve city blocks to the Square in the middle of downtown Charlotte all by myself so that I could spend the rest of the afternoon in my mother’s new sewing shop where she was beginning work the very day that I started school. That excited me, and I was a little uneasy, too, because I had to walk from school to my mother’s new shop all by myself. </p><p>My first grade teacher was Miss Belvin. I knew which door to enter (the front door) and which room to enter (the first one on the right-hand side of the hallway) and I knew how to walk to my mother’s new job. I was set for the year. I was going to learn to read and write. I was pleased. I could have used a friend to walk with on the way to school, and on my way to my Mother’s sewing shop, but my sister was beginning the seventh grade at a brand new high school named Harding High School, and she wouldn’t be home until 3:30 that afternoon. My school was named Bethune, and it was very old. I arrived at the school on time, and began my adventure into learning to read, write, add, and subtract, and how not to make your teacher mad at you if you could help it. But I also learned to take up for myself, because there was no body else to help me when some person was going to treat me wrongly. </p><p>My first day of school was also the first day I walked the mile from school to my Mother’s Sewing Shop on the Square all by myself. You can believe that when I left school I wasted no time getting safely to my Mother in her new sewing shop. When I arrived at the single room of the sewing shop I realized that the room was large, but it was also crowded. There was the cutting table, two sewing machines and chairs for the seamstresses to sit in, and against one wall a little home-made stand that had spools of thread in about every color a person could think of, and there was another chair for a customer to sit in if she, or he, had to wait for a while. Of course, most of the clients were women. And I also discovered that there was a beauty parlor just up the hall, and they had a telephone. The ladies in the shop were always nice to me, and I met all the ladies who gave permanents and curled hair, and once in a while I would help them make shampoo (on near, and that the door nearest us was a old man who took photographs of photographer’s , Just by a large table for cutting out garments, and </p><p>9999999999999999999999999999999999999</p><p>a friend, When I entered first grade at Bethune School my Mother went to work in uptown Charlotte, and I was not allowed to go home after school where I would be alone. Instead, each day when school closed for the day I walked close to a mile from the corner of West Nineth Street and Graham Street, all the way to the Square where I turned a corner onto first block of East Trade Street where my mother and her partner worked together in a one room sewing shop on the second floor of an old building, and it had two windows that looked out on East Trade Street, and on one of them there was a sign visible from the street that said in red letters: “King and Yandle Sewing Shop”. The sign hung over East Trade Street, but from my motherMrs. Octavia King and my mother, Minnie Yandle, were the two owners of the shop located in a building that was nearly as old as the city. The building was owned by Miss Sally Davidson, who was still hale and hearty, and came each month to collect her rent money from my Mother and Mrs. King. </p><p>That building does not exist now, as fifteen or so years ago it was razed, as were several other buildings on that corner, and in its place a huge auditorium was built. For many long years there had been no suitable Auditorium for performers. When in the 1920’s motion pictures became the rage, several motion picture theatres were built, and one of them was built with a limited stage area for live performances. Although it served the purpose for years, it was not totally satisfactory for large performances. but none of them were actually built for live There was one or perhaps two theaters which to aid The year that I enrolled in the first grade at Bethune School that was located on the corner of Graham Street and Ninth Street, and it was not a new school. It had served Charlotte well for many years. There was a very nice schoolyard beside and behind the school, however the school had been there for many years, and though at one time there had been monkey bars, a sliding board, and swings for the young students, when I entered the school, only the money bars and the ladder of the sliding board had survived near the back door of the school, and where there was a larger open area at the side of the school, all that was left of the swing set was the steel tubes that could have supported six or eight swings. The steel tubes that might have supported swings no longer had chains or swing seats. The ground at the side and back of the school was red dirt, and the only real accommodation for the students was a water fountain close to the side door of the school. </p><p>e years the original Court House though it was probably made of wood, and didn’t do much for the .

I knew that one family disappeared when they left home for California, and after the San Francisco earthquake that family disappeared and was never hear from again, though family members traveled to California to search for them. I know that some of my kin lived in Montana on a ranch and that some lived in Detroit and were associated with the building of automobiles. I learned fairly recently that some of the Yandles moved into the Philadelphia area, and so our family and the many people who came from England simply spread out all over the growing nation, and in different areas of the country the spelling of the name was different. </p><p>When I was in high school I discovered there were several students of different ages who were also Yandles; however they did not spell their names exactly as I did. It is fairly easy to figure out why, because back in the early 1800’s when most of the people entering the nation that eventually became the United States were daring to travel across the Atlantic. Even those who were siblings did not always spell their name the same way. It was spelled Yandle, Yandel, Yandal, and Yandele. I met several cousins while attending Harding High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, and each of them spelled the name differently. </p><p>Travel back in the early days of our country was not as easy as it is today.

My Dad’s family was mostly Methodist, and my Mother’s family was Baptist. Church was important in both families, and has remained so for many generations. </p><p>My earliest memories are, of course, very sketchy. Most genuine memories of very small children are based on great pleasure, fright, or intense pain. Little things, sweet moments, and simple enjoyment, don’t usually write themselves indelibly on the memory. Because I am now seventy-five years old, my memories span years when the world, our nation, our home, was very different than it is today. Not long ago during a telephone conversation my sister who is seven years older than me asked me if I remembered anything much about living on East Fifth Street. I managed to drag quickly through my earliest memories of about seventy two or more years ago, and pulled up two clear mind pictures. One very vivid one was that I was in a black place, alone, terrified, and screaming because I couldn’t get out. The other one was of sitting on the floor of our front porch, playing, and trying to move, or pick up an odd half circle of sunshine on the floor. There was one more—not in our house but in the other side of the duplex. There was a grandmotherly lady who lived there with her husband, and they had a sofa in their living room. I remember standing on her sofa, then running across the cushions to cuddle in her lap. </p><p>My sister laughed at my memories, and told me that the one about the sun on the floor was because the porch was surrounded by a solid half wall instead of an ordinary banister, and the builders had cut small crescents at floor level to prevent rain from pooling on the porch floor. At certain times of the day the sun could shine directly through the curved openings making bright crescents of sunshine on the porch floor. </p><p>The other memory was of sheer terror because of black darkness. Ella Cornelia explained that one day I was allowed to play alone in the back yard. I decided go back into the house, which was, for me, a mistake. The very small entry way had neither window nor an electric light, and the back door closed behind me as I walked into the entry way, leaving me trapped in the dark. Ella Cornelia rescued me, making everything all right for a frightened little girl. </p><p>After that I remembered the kitchen of the house we moved into shortly after that scare. The new house was also a duplex, and in it we lived in the downstairs area that consisted of three rooms and a hallway. This was the house I lived in until I was married. 9999999999999999</p><p>and after about seventy years I thanked opened the door to the very small vestibule and rescued me from pitch black dark. Of course, as soon as I was out of a very small hallway Mother was busy in the kitchen, and when I began to scream she asked my sister to check on me. The entryway was very small, and without windows, however, the fact that there was no electric light in that small I decided to go into the house. Unfortunately for me, there was no light in the entry way which had discovered that a three year old couldn’t reache entry way had no She met me in the very small back entry way, and guided me into our kitchen. Ella Cornelia told me that the entry from the back yard was sort of odd. The outside door opened into a small entry way about three feet square which served as a hallway. There </p><p>Suddenly, both she and our Mother heard me screaming, and Ella Cornelia hurried toward the back yard to check Duplex houses are two dwellings that are separated only by one shared wall. Usually the kitchens and bathrooms were close to the center of the house to make connections to electricity, water and sewage The two dwellings are usually mirror images of each other, with connections to electricitykitchens side by side, and often with hallways also side to side. Usually the houses have adjacent front porches and back doors. That was sort of the way the house on East Fifth Street was designed. I truly don’t remember the layouts of the rooms, and I actually have three how that house was designed. However, my sister mentioned that there was a central back door that opened into a very narrow hall, that had openings to both left and right that led into that hall there was an entry to both the left and the right, each leading into there was a back door that opened onto a very narrow sort of hall way, My sister said that the back entry of that house was a little different, as there was only one back door that opened into a . Picture a square space only as wide as a door and its frame, and only long as a door and its frame. There are four equal sides to this hall which offered entrance to both sides of the duplex from the single back doorand three of the sides are also doorways. The fourth side may have been a doorway, too, though my sister didn’t remember clearly where that fourth door might have led. The door from the yard into the house was the back door. The two side doors , one to the left, one to the right, gave entry into short halls that to either the left or the right side of the houseThe back opened into the yard, the two side doors opened into could have , and possibly the fourth side, were all doors. “sides” as long as the width of two other doors, one on each side of a square space that did not actually have much wall space because most of the wall space was taken up by closed doors. , as it opened into a very small space that had three doors.

On both the left and the right of the space was a door leading into both sides of the house, the left and the right as the space was narrow, and was not larger than of the house, and once inside it was a cramped space, as it was only as wide of the door. The side walls were also cramped, as they, too, were only doorways—one on each side that opened either into, or near to, the kitchens on both sides of the duplex. consisted of only a doorway, one opening to the left, the other opening to the right side At the back of the house there was a narrow hall, with at least three openings. There was, of course, the back door, and on each side of the hall was a door leading into both the left and the right side of the house, near the kitchen area. There was no electric light in that narrow square hall, The hall was as wide as the back door and its frame. On each side of that hall the entire wall space was taken up by door frames on each side, each opening into the , but no electric light within it.

She said that it was an odd sort of arrangement, because the space was so very small, no wider than the door itself, and it frame.

It was a solid half wall, and at intervals all way the back door was different from any other back entrance she had ever seen. She remembered clearly only one outside door on the back wall of the house. When a person entered through that back door he was in a narrow and short four-sided square hall that was no larger than the width of the three or possibly four doors plus their door frames. When my sister was describing that narrow square hall she could re-member only three doors, which of course would each have had a door frame. The floor space was square, and was just large enough to turn around in order to move to the left or the right through Th remember if there were only three doors or if there was a fourth one that had slipped her mind.

In our side of the duplex there was a door which opened into a very narrow space, aThe and making with an odd half circle shape of sunshine on the floor. My sister then told me about both of those experiences, as it was she who rescued me from the dark, and she remembered about the front porch, too</p><p>The easy one was the half circle of sunshine on the porch floor. The front porch was not surrounded by a simple banister with slender square sticks holding a flat board railing. There was a partition that would hold up a railing. There was a partition that separated the two porches and the front of the two porches was a solid That partition a solid wall about the same height as a banister would have been. It that a banister would be, but definitely not see-through, and made instead of solid woodof a banister that surrounded the porch. At floor level there were several cut-outs along the base of the porch’s half-wall to allow rain, or scrubbing to flow off the porch. The openings were rounded archeswater ting it. The house was sort of different in two ways. First, it was two houses separated only by one wall, with both sides of the house under one roof. Each side of the house had a front door, however, my sister remembered only one entrance at the back of the housethere was only one wall reaching from floor to roof that separated the two halves of the house, and above them was only one roof. between them, and they shared the same roof. There was a sturdy half-wall topped with a flat banister top that formed a sort of solid fence around both front porches. rather than a simple banister. At intervals there was an arch cut through that half wall, and and the wall </p><p>we were living in was a duplex, and there were two front doors. However, my sister remembered only one entry at the back of the house, which led into a tiny hall. That hall had only one actual wall, because the door from the outside took up the entire back wall of that small entry way, and on each side of that door were two other doors, one into each side of the duplex, and it was not larger than the space it took to hang a door on both the right and left sides of that tiny hallway to give entry to both sides of the duplex. Ella Cornelia, my sister, couldn’t recall if there was a fourth door, or just a narrow wall on the fourth side of that tiny hallway. But she can be forgiven for not remembering byou then only as wide as the doorways of the other three sides of that small member if there was a fourth door, each side that would open into both sides of the duplex close to the kitchen area. that wayentry from the yard , and didn’t really have a with a door on both the left and right, making a back entry way that was only as wide as the back door, and only as deep as the two doors that led into both the right and the left on both the right and left of the back doorand not an inch more than that. To the left and right were two other doors that led into the kitchen area of both sides of the duplex, , both entry space had three doors: the back door, and two side doors, and where there were doors there was no real wall space—only the door and the necessary space to attach the hinges on one side of the door, and the lock on the other side of the door. One door led into or out of the yard, one door led into our side of the house, and the other door led into the other side of the house. Sister thought there might have been a door sized wall on the other The door from the yard into the house led only to a small hallway that had no walls on three sides of a sort of hallway, no bigger than it had to be to have three doors on t that had no electric light.

The first one , but I didn’t remember anything else. She said she knew about that one, but what else did I remember from about the same time? So I told her about a shadow I remembered, and we both laughed, because . Then I recalled I recall adventures in my past I am seventy-five years old, and will be seventy-six within the next few months. Unfortunately for me my memory is so crowded that in some instances items I should remember seem to have been erased—perhaps by accident—but nevertheless, they no longer exist in my head. Several months ago I was speaking by telephone with my sister who is six years plus a few months of the seventh year older than I am. We speak on the telephone frequently, as we live in different States. My sister, Ella Cornelia Yandle May, and I were chatting away when I mentioned those two early memories and admitted I didn’t understand either of them. She chuckled, and said, “Oh, I can tell you that.” And she did. </p><p>One day about seventy two years ago, she heard me crying very loudly, apparently behind the door of an oddly constructed hallway. She immediately came toward my screams to see why I was so upset. She opened a door leading into a narrow hall, and rescued me. </p><p>My sister explained that on that day I had been allowed to play alone in the back yard, and had tried to enter the house without help, though I was only three years old. Unfortunately the very small back hallway had no electric light, nor was there a window. The entryway was exactly square, and was as wide on all four sides as a door and its frame. One of the doors opened into the back yard, and two of them opened in separate directions into each side of the duplex. Ella Cornelia couldn’t remember (after more than seventy years) if there was a fourth opening into that small hallway. She did remember opening the door and comforting me because I had been terrified in that small dark entryway.</p><p>The second memory was perhaps earlier than the one about the door. In that memory I was on the floor that seemed to be of wood. There were walls around me. However the sun was shining very brightly though I was in the shade, and in front of me there was a precise splash of sunshine that looked like half of a bright warm circle. My sister reminded me that the solid banisters on the porch of that house were like a half wall, and not like the banisters in the house we moved into when I was still three years old. 9999999999999 That banister was made of little square posts that let in rain, and/or sunshine, with a solid railing on top of the thin posts. just a railing held up by thin wooden studs through which wind and sun could that from top to bottom it was a sturdy solid barrier between the porch and the very close sidewalk. Because the top of that wall was, like banisters, only about three feet from the porch floor, it was prudent to have openings for rain water in the event that a heavy rain fell onto the porch from above the banisters. Therefore the builder designed several arched openings at floor level through which rain water could run off the porch, and through which the sun could cast a bright splash of precisely arched sunshine which caught my attention though I was very young. </p><p>My Parents, Minnie and Leroy Yandle, were not rich, but they were strong. My mother 999999999999999. Their parents were farmers, and they were folk who had lived near Pineville, in Mecklenburg County, about ten or fifteen miles from Charlotte. My Dad’s family had moved around a little, living for a while on the other side of the Catawba River near a town called Mount Holly. There were many farmers who were from families who settled in the area of Pineville, North Carolina, located about ten or twelve miles from Charlotte, North Carolina. Pineville had a mill that made cotton cloth, and was not far from Fort Mill, South Carolina. The Southern Railroad passed through Pineville, as well as Fort Mill, and of course there was a Railroad Station in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was the largest city in the vicinity. Charlotte had a fairly large population, and there were mills, and manufacturers in that growing metropolis. The Catawba River flowed through North Carolina and South Carolina, and eventually the river was damned so that its flow would power machines that made electricity for Charlotte and other towns in the vicinity. There were little towns and villages in North and South Carolina, and a few large towns were beginning to develop. Charlotte was one of them. </p><p>From the beginning people who settled in North Carolina in the Piedmont, not far from the border between North and South Carolina, were serious about establishing a city. They built a Court House, and proclaimed that its position was to be the “center” of the town they planned to name Charlotte, after the English Queen. The majority of the settlers were from England, though through that nation and most of Europe there were difficulties, and many people who were willing to risk their lives to move to a new country, even if it was across a wide and fearful sea. Thus it was that people who saw no hope for a good life in the place where they lived were willing to cross the sea in hopes that they could have better lives in the new land.</p><p>Therefore, from all of the European, British and Mediterranean countries people who had little hope of bettering their situations where they were living, simply left that place and tried to better their lives in a new and unknown place, where there were fewer people, and fewer bosses to take the cream off the milk of life before the poor could get a taste. In the new world, they were told, they could be more free of every difficulty except hard work, and that would be for their own sake—not for some overseer. </p><p>Moving across the sea was not free of cost. Families were often separated when some members of a family could make the trip, and others could not afford it. Moving to a new continent was never easy nor without difficulty, however, no matter what the risks, risk was more appealing than remaining where there was no hope of real freedom of movement, nor of moving outside a paltry way of life, no matter how hard you worked. Because some folk went to the “new world” and made a fortune, and then returned to their English home place with the wonderful news, many families made the trip to America as a group. There were many persons who struck out alone, or one husband and wife with their children who dared to cross the sea. Other families could not bear to separate themselves by such a distance, and therefore collected every member of the family who could make the trip to go as a group. And that was the way a large number of Yandles, and a large number of Johnstons came to the country that became the United States from England, Ireland, Scotland, and other points occupied by folk who had the name Johnston or Yandle. Those folks seemed to find Johnston fairly easy to write, and seldom spelled it any other way; however, Yandle was spelled in many different ways over time. It was spelled Yandel, Yandell, Yandal, and a few other versions. Many of the people with those two names were kin to each other. Johnston’s had married Yandles, and Yandles had married Johnstons, and when the kinship was not too close to prevent it, Johnstons had married Johnstons, and Yandles had married Yandles. It was a very large group. </p><p>In those years there was very little effective medicine for any illness. There was very little help for a woman during the birth of her child. Sometimes women had pregnancies too frequently, and had questionable health with no medicines that could be helpful, nor were there at that time such wonderful helpers as X-rays, and antibiotics and doctors who were specialists in birthing children. Sometimes there were neither available doctors, nor helpful medications. Another problem in that time was that Medicine, as we know it in the Twenty-First Century did not exist at all until late in the Twentieth Century. There were few medicines, and though there were doctors who were totally trustworthy, there were also doctors who discovered that medications were not effective by the trial and error. The lack of true antibiotics was often disastrous since physicians were helpless when there was nothing they could do to help their patients. </p><p>Having been born in the early 1930’s I suffered measles, and mumps, and chicken pox, and other illnesses, and there were no medications to prevent them. When poliomyelitis struck people either got well or were crippled for life or they died. People who had communicable diseases like Tuberculosis were required by law to enter a TB hospital, as it was highly contagious. They could not live at home. I had a friend not quite five years old who was suspected of having a lung illness, and she was snatched from her home (that happened to be next door to my home) and sent to the TB hospital where she stayed for at least five or six years, though she wasn’t really ill, because they didn’t know how to diagnose her problem. There were doctors who believed that trying to help a patient, even if it meant offering a medicine that had not been tested previously, was worth trying. That happened to my Aunt Helen, who took the medication, and discovered that the medicine ruined her teeth. A man my Mother knew became sick with a high fever, and the doctor said that his mother should use something that would splash water against his head every minute or so to reduce his fever. It turned out that the Romans had used that device as torture back in olden times, and the doctor didn’t realize it. People today still find there are illnesses that doctors and treatments cannot alleviate, but there are so many wonderful treatments for so many difficult illnesses today that people almost expect medicines or treatments to fix everything. When I was a child I was quarantined inside my house for measles and chicken pox, and I remember my Dad lifted me up so that for one of the illnesses I was able to jerk down the sign warning folks not to come into the house because I had a contagious disease. Though it was tough for me and my family while the sign was up, it was far better than allowing me to play with neighbor children and give them the sickness, too. </p><p>I have already mentioned that every afternoon when I had left school I went uptown to the Sewing Shop because there was no one at home to look after me. I spent the afternoon after school for three school years in my mother’s sewing shop, however close to the end of my Third year in school, a tragedy occurred in North Carolina and in other states as well. There was an outbreak of Infantile Paralysis in several states. Every school in Mecklenburg Country closed early that spring. A quarantine was ordered for all of Mecklenburg County that affected all children under sixteen years of age. Sixteen year old children who had jobs could go to work. It was suggested that those who did not have jobs or were not otherwise committed to being out in public to stay at home as much as possible. Parents were urged to keep their children away from other children, as Poliomyelitis was extremely contagious. </p><p>All over the city of Charlotte prudent parents obeyed the warning, and their children spent the summer inside, rather than outside, if at all possible. We had books at home, but I had already read all of them, more than one time. I loved going to the library, and read </p><p>In uptown Charlotte at that time there was to my knowledge only one major store in that vicinity that had air conditioning. All the others had a few ceiling fans to stir the warm air, and those in buildings with more than one floor usually did not make use of the top one, hoping the temperature would be less if it was not too close to the roof. School age children were bored stiff. The Charlotte Parks and Recreation people had very little to do, as no children were invited to the parks and were instead urged to stay away. Radio stations filled any spots in the stations morning and afternoon programs with thirty minute programs about games that could be played at home, and the Recreation Department sent out packages of pencil and paper mazes and games to help keep the children busy inside their homes on hot afternoons, instead of going outside to play with other children in the neighborhood. </p><div

</code></pre></div><p>Even so, I remember that summer because I was bored. I couldn’t go to the library, I couldn’t see a movie, I couldn’t play with children in my neighborhood, and I couldn’t even go to church.<br/> Each evening I telephoned my mother who was working in a sewing shop in the up-town area, and she helped me quickly plan supper, and I cooked it, so that supper would be nearly ready by the time she returned home. That was a long and boring summer. I swept and dusted and washed and ironed clothes because there was nothing else to do except read, and I read a great number of books from the library that my sister Ella Cornelia graciously stopped by to select for me. </p><p>There was no medicine and no cure for that illness. If you became ill the chances were that you would never again walk, and you might not even be able to breathe without an iron lung. That illness was one of the most terrible I had ever heard of, and then I learned that President Roosevelt had suffered from that disease. When I was in college I had a class mate who walked only with braces and crutches. She was a lovely girl, and intelligent. She graduated in the same class I did, but she died before she was thirty years old. I felt so very blessed that I did not have that disease. </p><p>over the responsibility of the kitchen work—cooking and serving meals, preserving food in the summer and fall for use through the winter, cleaning the house, washing not only dishes, but also the laundry usually outside in a boiling pot, and keeping the kitchen tidy. I’m sure her older sister Martha helped with the chores, and for a time, and the youngest sister also. However the youngest girl finished high school she went to college, and when she came home she went to work in Charlotte. the laundry, preparing meals, and laying by foods in the fall for use through the winter, until a new garden could be planted and </p><p>something to do with the way she lived her life. She was the oldest girl child in that family, and since my grandmother was not actually well as long as I knew her, and was told that she had beensort of fragile, as were a great many women who had no access to birth control. I was told as a child that my Grandmother Yandle was too sick to do anything except grandmother that. She lived well into her nineties, and was not far from a hundred years old when she died. </p><p>A large group of them came on the same ship, or quickly there after. I found it fairly strange that before they entered their new country there were a big bunch of those people who had once been Johnstons who married Yandle men, and another bunch of Yandle ladies who married Johnstons. There seemed to be so many of both that they were all kin to each other, and when would convince not only one ma and pa with On other And so it was with folk who left family members behind to begin a new life across the sea. Then there were families who did not want to leave parents, children, sisters, brothers, cousins, or other kin behind them. So when it was possible, entire families embarked across the sea at the same time. Parents, uncles, aunts, children, cousins, mates and their close family members, all sometimes came either on the same ship, or on carefully spaced trips across the ocean with plans to meet in this new world to offer support and help for each other when settling into their new and challenging lives. This was the decision of some of my ancestors, many of whom had the same last name. They came in family groups, and a great many of them were named Yandle, Yandel, Yandal, Yandell, and a few other odd spellings of the same name. Some were brothers and sistsers, parents and children, cousins, or aunts or uncles, and a few women who once had a different name, but married either a Johnston or a Yandle. strangely enough they were all related in some way, either closely or not so close, and there were Johnstons that married Yandles and Yandles, so that the folk who took that particular ship mostly answered to either Johnston or Yandle when those names were called. M that married Johnstons. It was customary in those days that when a woman died in childbirth, and that was a sad, but regrettably a frequent occurrence, and since there were few medications that would save folk from dying young there were some of them who came over the sea with one name, and later married some were cousins and a bunch of the Yandle group had kinfolk name Johnston, and a bunch of Johnstons came along with them. I suppose that any of those folk were related, being parents, children, cousins, uncles, aunts, grandparents, or half sisters, brothers, or some other relationship that I haven’t thought of yet. </p><p>really freelands had been taken over by other peoples the crowded Europe were of course there were people from other European and North African nations as well. Strong countries were attacking weaker ones,At that time there was unrest in several countries, with people who and travel, especially by sea, was frequent. When it was difficult to make a living in their birthplace, many people simply moved toward the lands across the Sea which had been discovered, and about which rumors had spread along with marvelous reports of riches and opportunity. In crowded areas with little hope of gaining a better way of life people who lived in near despair simply left those places that held little hope of bettering themselves to live in a brand new world where hard work and effort could make a person rich in land and possessions, with more freedom than they enjoyed in their present homeland. Many of the travelers were from England, Ireland, Scotland, France, Russia, China, Italy, and many from North Africa. </p><p>Eventually the European folk, including England, as well as nearly allof the entire world, was at the mercy of peoples who were powerful and ruthless. Many strong leaders had not one single qualm about killing women and children, as well as the defenders of whatever place they were attacking at the moment. Any strong ruler could decide he wanted more of whatever and whoever he had discovered, and if he believed he could win a battle with the expected opposition, that strong warrior took the risk of attack, killing those who opposed him, and risking the lives of all his followers who would be believed anywhere on earth either began, or continued, to believe that people who were different from themselves were much less worthy of respect than themselves, and the old habit from Bible times of making prisoners and slaves of both the soldiers and mere citizens of a captured nation whose options were to accept slavery or death. Families were divided, men and women and their children were separated and neither the lives or the health of slaves was not a problem. One of them died? There was another to take his/her place. No probl, treated more Slavery was usually cruel, became the cruel rule of the day. </p><p>Powerful people who could protect themselves and their holdings were forced to defend their domains successfully or become the servants of their conquer stronger believed the people from countries they invaded could be used as slaves, since that had been one of the results of Roman and Greek and Egyptian occupations of other parts of their world. Dark skinned folk from Africa were transported into the area to help change the wilderness into a more “civilized” sort of country. Most of the world, up to that time, had always used conquered people as slaves. Often it was the slaves who actually built huge cities, and provided strong defense during war times in almost the entire entire world. </p><p>As Charlotte grew, men with strong ideas of self government wanted to build a new and better nation, free from restrictions that kept working people from rising in the world, and denied them the right to education and opportunities to rise above their beginnings. Because they were human, those who became leaders on this new continent were not always perfect in their plans and decisions, but for the most part, the new nation of small states multiplied, and eventually established the United States of America. People from many countries all over the known world arrived to join those who were determined to have a fresh and new beginning in a place that was not already old, and so set in its ways that there was little hope for change for the people living there. </p><p>I was born early in the year of 1931. There were forty-eight States within the United States, and a world wide war had been fought to preserve liberty in the world. When the Great War was over, and the soldiers came back home, everything was different. Somewhere in my youth I remember a line from a song sung by our troops during that war. The lyrics asked a question: “How do you keep them down on the farm after they’ve see Paris”? The answer was that you couldn’t keep people from continuing to expand their thinking and their actions after such an experience. </p><p>Home Great Depression had already occurred Who is seldom actually the first one is of me, playing on a wooden floor. The sun is shining, and there is a shadow on the floor. The shadow is cast by the banisters that are like a solid half-wall between our porch and the street. There is at least one very bright spot on the floor because the sun can shine through a crescent shaped hole where the solid banister touches the floor. The opening was to allow rain to run off the porch through that very small opening. I think the shiny crescent is interesting, and put my hands in the bright light. That is the end of that scrap of my memory of the front porch. Ironically my other memory of that house is at the rear door, which had an odd sort of access. From each kitchen a door opened into the same small hallway at the back of the house, 99999999999999999999999999999999999</p><p>And within arms reach there was another door opening into the back yard. That tiny hall was a square, with a solid wall on one side, and three doors on the other three sides, one door into each side of the duplex, and one door opening into the back yard. Instead of having a door opening into the back yard for each side of the duplex, there was only one opening from a very small square hall, oddly fashioned to serve as an entry from the back yard, and two other doors offered entry to without an electric light. The doors and their frames It was , through which allowed occupants of either side of the duplex to allowed of either side of the duplex had access to the back yard for each side of the duplex, there was one solid door opening into the back yard from a very small square hallway.

I was outside the house in the back yard playing. I wanted my mother, and after more than seventy years I have forgotten why I wanted her. I opened the door leading to a narrow square hall with three doors. The door behind me closed, shutting out all light, and leaving me alone in a small black dark space. I panicked and screamed. My sister heard me and opened the door from our house into enclosed entry way that had three doors try way tried to go into the house to find her. I opened the door and stepped into the small hallway, and behind me the solid outside door closed shut behind me, leaving me in pitch darkness. I was r. I was going into the house, but as soon as I entered a small square hallway, the door to the outside closed, making the hall pitch black. I was standing alone in the small totally dark hallway. I screamed and screamed until my sister opened the door into our house. I open a door and step inside the house. The door behind me closes, and I am in pitch dark. I can’t find the door in the dark, and I scream. Someone opens a door and I see my sister, so I am not frightened anymore, but I am still crying. I mentioned that memory to my sister who is older than I am. She told me that there was a very small entry way at the back of the house that served both sides of the duplex. It had three doors, one for each side of the duplex, and one leading into the back yard. There was no light in that space, and no windows. Once we moved away I was never in the house again, but I did see the outside of it from across East Fifth Street when we visited the house owned by my Great Aunt Elizabeth (nicknamed Lizzie) and her brother, Uncle Edward (nicknamed Ed). I had an opinion of both Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Ed when I was about five years old, and it was that they were different from anyone else I had ever met. Both of them were very thin people. Uncle Ed was tall and thin, and Aunt Lizzy was shorter, and also thin. At table they didn’t eat very much, as if they were not, after all, very hungry. My Daddy, who was a painting contractor, would sometimes as Uncle Edward’s advice on business, and he would often take his advice. I understood that both of these odd people were kin to me, but I didn’t really know exactly how they were related to us for a number of years. </p><p>It seems that my Dad’s Granddaddy, who was named Milas Yandle was married twice. My Grandfather Amos Yandle was Milas Yandle. My Grandfather Amos was the child of his first wife. When she died, he married again, and He had children by his first wife, and their son was my Grandfather, Amos Yandle. Amos’s mother died young, and his father remarried. Because Amos’s father was my Dad’s Grandfather , my Great Grandfather Yandle, mother died, as occurred often in those daysand his father married again. I think that his second wife already had two children, one named Edward and one named Elizabeth. Therefore Edward and Elizabeth were half brother and sister to my Grandfather, which made them Uncle Ed and Aunt Lizzie to my father, his brother, and his three sisters. that made my grandfather’s children call their children Uncle and Aunt. They were probably quite young when they earned those titles. However, my Dad’s Granddaddy married again, and I think now that his second wife already had young children, so that my Grandfather Amos was a step-brother to Uncle Edward and Aunt Lizzy. Of couse I could be wrong, and there is no one to ask, now, because Grandparents and all the uncles and aunts are now deceased. discuss thing with Uncle Ed, asking his advise on business things, and Uncle Ed would always tell Daddy what he wanted to know.<br/> I, at a very young age, thought she looked like a paper doll—too thin to be real. Aunt Lizzie always wore a dress that was about ten inches from the floor—much longer than everybody else wore. She had some sort of problem with her eyes, and they always looked odd to me. She did not wear glasses, and she could read, though her eyes looked very dark. Uncle Ed and see tall and slender, and neither of them talked exactly like all the other people in our family who one and all spoke in the Mecklenburg County Southern Drawl. Though my grandparents on both sides of my family were all country people, all of them had gone to school. They all spoke good English with just a touch of a Southern Drawl. However, Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Ed pronounced words, and had vocabularies quite different from the rest of the family. Both of them had an odd way of talking—not like other folk raised in the South. Neither of them was funny, in the sense that they laughed a lot. I remember Uncle Ed’s smile, and a sort of change in his voice when he was amused, but not an actual laugh. I not sure I ever heard Aunt Lizzie actually laugh. She would smile and make a short lived humming sound, like “mn,mn,mn.” That was about the extent of their merriment. Both brother and sister were</p><p>The house where Uncle Ed and Aunt Lizzie (both given names were shortened Yandle house was a two story</p><p>’s house Of course I saw that house after I was grown, as my Great Aunt and Uncle lived across the street, but I was never in it again as my parents moved when I was about three years old from East Fifth Street to West Eleventh Street, and into another duplex where I lived until I married. </p><p>I remember the Eleventh Street house very well, though both the Fifth Street and Eleventh Street houses have been razed for years. The Fifth Street house was in the way of the Telephone Company I think, but the street still exists. West Eleventh Street has, along with the houses that once aligned the street, disappeared entirely. In its place there is a ramp which leads to an interstate highway that circles the city. Not too long ago my husband and I drove around in Charlotte during a visit, and I discovered that about the only thing left of that block of West Eleventh Street is the corner curbing that once touched both Eleventh Street and Pine Street. The Pine Street curbing, with , was once a part of the corner sidewalk where Eleventh Street met North Pine Street met. Only the North Pine Street curb is visible, as the 400 block of West Eleventh Street no longer exists. . b still has the name of the street Since we no longer live in Charlotte and it was razed when I was in grammar school. The house on Eleventh Sho, and that house I remember as and I I can’t see where I because there is no light. I scream. Someone opens another door, and lets me into a room where there is light. Recently I told my older sister what I remembered, and she told me that our house was a duplex, and that at the back, there was an unlighted space where there were there three doors: one into our side of the duplex, one into the other side of the duplex, and one to the outside. hall along our hall there was an unlighted a that has At the bottom of the banisters there is at least almost solid that surround the porch. But on more than one places along the half wall of the banixbright center of the shadow is a crescent of One of my first memories are dim. I am playing on the floor of the front porch. The sun is shining, but the banisters are not just a row of slender square sticks as they were on Eleventh Street. The banisters are solid, covered with something like shingles but where they touch the porch floor there are openings to let rain water drain off the porch.

The floors were of dark wood, as children had been treading on them for many, many years, and Janitors had oiled the floors frequently. Student was a new word for me. I discovered that I, myself, was a student. I was a student because I was going to school. School was a red brick building with dark shiny floors and rooms with very large windows and small desks in neat rows, with a big desk in front that had a person named teacher behind it. The teacher behind the desk in the room I entered was not as tall as my mother. She was not skinny, but she wasn’t fat either. The floor of the hall way that led to the room was dark, almost black. The floor of the room was like the hallway. Just by walking on it I was aware that the floor of both hall and classroom was a little slippery, and as I had on new shoes, I walked carefully. That night I asked my Dad why it was so slick, and he said that the janitors probably put something on the floor to keep it clean. Of course I had never before thought of that, and don’t know that it was true, but I do know that the floor was slippery, and that the tables and chairs in that room skidded about at the least touch. </p><p>My teacher was Miss Belvin, and our room was very near the front door of the school. We had nice desks that were the right size—not to small, and not too big. The little desks were scattered in rows, one behind the other, and each one had a little chair just the right size for sitting at the desk. I had seen school rooms with rows of desks that were attached to each other and that were screwed to the floor so they wouldn’t move. My room was not like that. Each desk sat all by itself, with a chair behind each one. I discovered that the desks were not nailed to the floor, but could be moved. The chairs could be moved, too, so students could sit close to their desks, or move back to make room to stand up. </p><p>When the teacher began to talk to us she pointed out a table that had paper on it. When we were doing our school work we go to that table and get a clean sheet of paper when we needed it. There was a blackboard on the front wall, and plain walls on each side of the room. The back wall was different because it had very large windows that let in lots of light, and sometimes when it was warm outside and the windows were open, they let in a little breeze. The windows were so high we couldn’t really look out of them into the yard, and when they were open we could hear cars and trucks that moved along the street. There wasn’t much to see, anyway, except a red dirt school yard, and the pipes that had once supported swings for children to use during recess. Close to the brick walls of the school there were two water fountains. On our side of the school that was about all that was there. </p><p>If you walked all the way around the school, you would find that behind the school there had once been a sliding board, but there was no slick metal board to slide on. Only the ladder and two tall pipes that had once supported the top of a sliding board were still there. To my surprise, when other classes were out in the school yard the children would climb the ladder and then wrap their legs around the two pipes and slide down the pipes to the ground. When no one was sliding, students would use the pipes to pull themselves upward, climbing up those pipes like moneys, and then sliding down to the ground again. </p><p>A little way from what had once been a sliding board was something I had never before seen. It was called monkey bars. Children lined up at one end of the contraption, and was what we called monkey bars. This was also made with poles and ladders, but the longest ladder was two or three four or five feet from the ground, and it was horizontal. Children would climb a short ladder, grab hold of the rungs of the flat ladder high up rungs and slide down the pipes, sort of like the pictures in where Beyond the swings there was a low rock wall, a little bit of dirt, and a filling station. been a swing set, but now had no swings, and the beyond that the roof of the service station on the corner, and which had once held several swings for children to use. Now there were no swings hanging there, but the pipes that had once held them up were still there. Eventually I realized that older girls would fling themselves around those pipes, swinging out and landing as far form the pipe as they could. At one end of the swing set there was a low frock wall, and sometimes the girls leaned from the rock wall to hold onto the pipe, and then pushed themselves our to swing around the pipe and land on the other side of it on top of the wall again. Where there wasn’t anything to clime up on, the girls just sort of swung back and forth on the pipe, reaching higher with each swing, and when they were as high as they wanted to go, they would wrap their legs around the pipe and slide down. walked their hands up the pipe, and then slid down to the ground again. to swing by their hands, and sometimes they just walked up that pipe, with their hands, getting more than head high just hanging onto the pipe, then wrapping their legs around the pipe and sliding down. that were a little older than me could climb up those pipes using only their hands, and sort of swinging side to side while they lifted themselves higher and higher, reaching higher and higher with their hands around those pipes. but there were some tall pipes stuck in the ground that had been a swing set a long time ago. There were no chains for swings, but at each end there were three strong reaching up to the long pipe from which swings had hung. You could still see the hooks for the chains. It was mostly girls who played there. Counting both ends of the swing set there were six pipes in all, three pipes at each end of the swing set. Girls liked to play there, and they climbed the three pipes at each end of the empty swing set by pulling themselves up with their hands, But the girls now. But swings, and no chains, either. , and a long time ago there had been swings hanging from the top pipe that was held up by three strong pipes at each end, and another one that was in the middle of the long top pipe. Once it had held a lot of swings. That year there were no swings, but the school children used the pipes, anyway. The older girls would grab hold of the slanted pipes, and walk up them using only their hands, swinging back and forth, and going higher and higher with every swing, holding on with one hand. When they were as high as they wanted to go, they could wrap their legs around the pipe, and slide down. close both hands around the slanted pipes, and swing to one side, hanging on with one hand. The other hand would move up, and then the girl would swing her feet the other way, and lift with the other hand, sort of climbing up higher and higher ing from side to side and reaching up from side to side. Then they would reach with one hand to a higher place, and then reach with the other hand, </p><p>, and it any way. There was room for that formed a tripod. Of course, back then I didn’t know that a tripod was a three legged thing that could bear weight, but I did know that atthings (pipes, sticks, beams, or even pencils, well fastened together at one end and spread out at the other made a sort of legged , but later I learned that a three legged stool, or a contraption that could support a really heavy tripod made a very safe and sturdy prop for a great number of things, especially people could build. My Uncle Vance had one that would hold really heavy engines, and little short ones would hold a big pot so that a fire could be made under the pot, .from a little stool to sit on to that needed to be vast sort of different stuff, such as teepees (the tent of Indians) or of thewith a little bit of a rock wall in one place, and barely visible behind that the roof of the filling station on the corner was visible. aif I stood on the floor, but I was well aware that all I would have seen was a dirt school yard, with a little rock wall, and the top part of the filling station that was the only other building on that block. </p><p>On the first day I learned about recess. For a short time each day our class would go outside to play. I also realized that, since I didn’t really know any of the children in the class, playing might be sort of hard to do. A little way to the right of the school there was a tall strong pipe with strong metal legs that could have held swings—but didn’t. Way back and sort of behind the building there was two other strong things made of the same kind of pipes. One was a sliding board but the part a child could slide on was missing. The pipes that would 999999999 The other thing looked like someone had bent a metal ladder at each end, and stuck the ends in the ground, leaving most of the rungs of the ladder between the short ends. Then I saw children climb one end, and grab the level rungs, and swing from rung to rung all the way across the flat part of that ladder. lined up at one end of aid a metal ladder across two short ladders, and I saw students climb on one end, and swing on their hands all you could climb on each end, and I soon learned that children could climb up one end, and then swing from the bars it was I learned was a </p><p>here was going to be hard to do, since there were no swings, and no see-saws, and no seats of any kind. There was only the dirt </p><p>hey were not affixed to the floor like the desks in some of the rooms. The teacher had a big desk in front of the class, but it was not in the middle. It was near a window. There were windows only at the back of the room, but there were lights in the ceiling. The teacher told me which desk was mine, and that I would sit there everyday. I didn’t need a notebook like my sisters. I could not yet read or write, so I didn’t need a notebook. The teacher gave us paper to write on when it was time to write. She gave us drawing paper when it was time to draw. She handed out books from which we would learn to read, and she had a big black board that she could write on. Our parents had to buy pencils and crayons for us. To begin with we had to stay at school until one o’clock. Then we could go home. </p><p>There was one problem that I faced. My mother was not at home, because she now had a job as a seamstress at a Sewing Shop uptown. My Dad was a painting contractor, and he had gone to work with the man who worked for him. Since my sister had gone to High School for the very first time, and to a brand new school named Harding High School that had just been built, no one was at my house. Mother had explained to me—more than once—that after school I was to walk straight to her work place and spend the afternoon there, being a good girl and not talking too much. I was not, under any circumstances, to enter our house since there was no one there, and the lock on the front door didn’t work. “Someone who is a bad person could be in the house when you go in, so don’t go in,” she said. So I never did.</p><p>I was well aware that strangers could just walk in. It happened more than one time, and it was usually in the evening or at night. I well remember that one winter night a man who was drunk staggered down our hall and walked into the kitchen where all of us were sitting as it was the only warm room in the house that evening. The man was not sturdy on his feet, and swayed a little when he stopped. My Dad stood up, and asked “what do you want?” The man said, “I just want to go to bed.” My Dad, who was six feet three inches tall, and looked strong and able said, “You can’t go to bed here, you’ll have to go to your house.” The poor drunk man was almost weeping, and he said again, “I just want to go to bed.” But when my Dad walked toward him and told him that he couldn’t sleep here, and that he was in the wrong house, the man turned and went away. </p><p>As young as I was, I knew about drunks. 3 years drunks9999999999999999When I was about four years old I was never allowed to climb the stairs to the toilet. I had a potty inside the pantry, not because I wasn’t trained, but because my mother and dad didn’t trust the people who were renting the upstairs. It was a married couple, and they both used alcohol. They were often drunk, and mother said he was like a fox in a chicken coop—one that had a key to the door of the coop. It was inconvenient for my parents, but I never so often that </p><p>I decided that the old drunk man was sort of like the Rickmans who had once lived in the three upstairs rooms in our house. Mr. Rickman was a drunk, though I don’t remember whether or not his wife drank liquor. Mother wouldn’t allow me to use the bathroom by myself because it was at the top of the stairs and it was it was the only one in the house. She said “I don’t trust that man”because she didn’t trust that man. There was also a man and his wife who lived upstairs in hour house and he was often inebriated. Mother didn’t trust him, and until I was at least six she wouldn’t even let me go upstairs by myself because he was both a bad man and a drunkard. I was glad when they moved out. </p><p>There was house on both the other side of the street and the other end of the block that was a boarding house. He may have simply gone to the wrong end of the block on the wrong side of the street. been mixed up, Most of the boys in the class discovered that they could slide on the floor, and that it was easy to slip down on that floor. The school, my Dad said, was old. The walls looked old to me. The windows were different from the ones in our house. I expected to find rows of desks with legs that were screwed to the floor. I had been inside the school before, and most of the rooms had that kind of desk, and the tables and chairs looked new. I discovered that the first grade room was very different from the others. Our desks were different, and our chairs were not bolted to the floor. Instead, they had silvery button on ever leg of every wooden chair. We also had a very different kind of desk. Every student had a small table with a small shelf beneath it to hold books. Of course every pupil had a both a chair and a desk, and both desk and chair slid easily along the floor which looked damp, as if it had just been mopped. The floor didn’t look waxed, but it was shiny. The chairs were easy to slide, too, with little shiny ball-like things on the bottom of the legs. The teacher said that was so they would slide quietly, and easily. The problem that arose was that the chairs moved so easily that if you pushed a certain way, the chair and the student could slide away from desk or table and more often than not the chair would tilt a bit and turn over. On the first day the teacher would hurry to the fallen child, but soon she realized, as did all the students, that almost, if not all of the “accidents” were on purpose. Those chairs made a lovely noise when they hit the floor, and the kind teacher came running to help the poor little child (mostly boys) to stand up, always asking if he or she was hurt. </p><p>After a few days, Miss Belvin laid down the law: if your chair turns over, you must stand facing a corner of the room, and you couldn’t turn your head at all. The only thing you could see was the corner wall. Only the children who were “cut-ups” kept turning over their chairs, and though it took a while, eventually they stopped doing it on purpose because it surely wasn’t any fun to stare at a wall. Even so, there were still the “smart elects” who would risk turning over their chairs. The result was always loud, unexpected, and disruptive. The fallen ones usually laughed, and stood in a corner. Miss Belvin was less and less concerned about their possible “injury,” as most of them did it on purpose. </p><p>There were fewer and fewer splats on the floor, but they still happened occasionally. There came a day when I had to rise from my desk to get a clean sheet of paper from the supply desk. I wanted to finish my work, perhaps being a little less careful than I normally was, but the result was that my chair moved away from me as I sat, and I hit the floor with a mighty thud, jarring my spine, sending pain up my back, and hurting my bottom. I was really hurting, and tears ran down my cheeks. The teacher didn’t leave her desk, but she looked at me and told me to stand in the corner. </p><p>I was stunned by the pain of hitting that floor. And I expected, and felt I had a right to believe that my teacher should care. She didn’t. And right then and there my respect for her hit rock bottom. I had tears in my eyes, but I go up. I said nothing to her at that moment, but I picked up my chair, placed it before my desk, and carefully and painfully sat down in it. I did not look at my teacher. She, however, looked at me. I’m sure by that time the tears were visible. Then she told me again to stand in the corner. I looked at her, and I said, “I’m not going to stand in the corner, because I didn’t mean to fall. I got hurt, and you don’t care.” Then I picked up my pencil and continued with my task, while my back ached and my anger smoldered. From that moment, I didn’t trust teachers at all. I discovered that very moment how rage could shoot up totally through a person, hot and quick. I didn’t know that forever after that I would take it for granted that teachers were not everything they looked like on the first day of school, and that they could make mistakes, and that I could stand up for myself when I was wronged. I didn’t realize that my backbone grew solid and strong that day, and that I would never again expect a teacher to be a good person just because of the title. I passed the first grade at the end of the year with a good grade, and I stopped by Miss Belvin’s desk in June and thanked her for teaching me. But I never again fully trusted a teacher to be perfect. I had discovered that they, too, could make mistakes. </p><p>In the First Grade I learned to read, and I learned to use numbers. I learned grownups and governments could make really silly rules, such as girls couldn’t wear long pants to school even in freezing temperatures and I learned to read, I learned to write, and I learned to eat lunch in a cafeteria. I learned that not all students wanted to learn, and some could be rowdy just for meanness. I discovered that recess was not much fun because there were no swings, or other play things on the school grounds, and I learned that you shouldn’t run full tilt into a rock wall because it could break a hole in your scull as it did one of the older students who almost died playing a silly game that required her to break through a circle of other girls holding hands, trying to keep that person inside of the circle of girls. I copied lessons from the blackboard, and I read out loud when it was my turn. I learned numbers, and in winter when it was very cold outside, I wore leggings to school, but I had to take them off when I was inside my classroom, even if it was chilly in the room, because it was against the rules of the school for girls to wear pants like a boy. That rule was enforced even when it was freezing outside and still chilly inside. We could wear sweaters, but not pants. Those were the rules. Since I walked three blocks to school my mother made me wear leggings under my dress, and a knitted cap on my head but the teacher expected me to take off the leggings when I took off my coat. </p><p>At the beginning of the year when I entered the First Grade I discovered that First Grade students left school earlier than the other students, and could go home at one o’clock. That was a problem for me, but not a big one. My mother had taken a job outside our home and wasn’t at home at 1:00 P.M. From the first day of school I was forbidden to go home when school was out because none of my family was at home that early in the afternoon. Daddy went to his work as a painting contractor, my sister, Ella Cornelia went to High School which had a longer “day” than my school, and my Mother stopped being just a mother by taking a job in a sewing shop. </p><p>The shop was run by Mrs. Octavia King and another person, who discovered she needed to be at home for a while, and Mrs. King asked my mother to join her as a partner. The sign on the window announced that the King and Yandle Sewing Shop was in that building. Mother worked there for a nearly ten years. Every day when school was out, I walked from school to the sewing shop and spent my afternoons there, doing my home work, reading, and fairly often I went out to ramble alone through Belk’s Department Store, and Woolworth’s, and sometimes I went out of Woolworth’s and into Efrids Department Store and happily rode the escalators which were like magic. Up I would go, and if I thought no one was looking, I would walk down those moving steps, hoping no one would pay any attention to me. If the Floor Walkers (that was the security folk) saw me, they would stop the escalators, and that would stop everyone from using the moving stairs. They were not, of course, like the ones we have today which go both up and down. The Efrids rolling stairs only went up. Shoppers could use the elevators to go down. As I grew up I had more freedom to wander around the stores on my own. </p><p>Dolls </p><p>already existed before my mother went to work, and two ladies had a number of regular customers when one of them was badly needed at home, and and had been a going concern for several years before my mother became a partner joinedhad two seamstresses working there. One of the ladies was now needed to be at home instead of away at a job, and Mrs. King asked my mother to take the place of the other lady. Mother joined Mrs. King as an equal partner, and the new name on the window of the shop said King and Yandle Sewing Shop. Mrs. King had once been our neighbor, though I didn’t remember her from my childhood. The new name of the shop was the King and Yandle Sewing Shop, located on the second floor of a building very near the Square on East Trade Street. The shop had been there for some time, and it stayed there for a number of years after that. Mother worked there for at least eight or ten years, and quit only when my Dad needed her to open the Yandle paint store precisely across the street from our house on Eleventh Street. </p><p>I could claim that I grew up well acquainted with two businesses. One was my mother’s, as she was a seamstress, and the other was my Dad’s, who was a painting contractor. Then there was the fact that with both my parents working I also learned how to keep house, cook, wash clothes, iron them, and then there was secretarial work I did for my Dad once I learned to typewrite. As I grew up was given the great pleasure of learning to play a violin, and I was in the school orchestra for seven years. After graduating from and in between and after those there was housekeeping, choir singing, and secretarial work. Then I became an aunt, and a few years later, a wife and mother, and I nursed babies for a while, then went back to work as a secretary. After a while I became a grandmother, and here lately I have become a great grandmother. a little bit of the third different businesses: the sewing shop until I entered my teen age years, and then the paint store until I graduated from college. As a first grader I walked to school alone, and I walked alone to my mother’s sewing shop until the year that the Polio epidemic forced the schools to close earlier that summer, and to delay a little the opening of the schools in the fall. The City of Charlotte banned children younger than sixteen from movie theaters, and churches, and no one younger than sixteen years of age could work in a public place. Children were banned from department stores, and were advised not to travel on the city busses. These were the most s d a city government rule that children under the age of sixteen had to stay at home. Children were encouraged to avoid playing with neighbor children, and were not allowed in theatres or the public library, and most of them didn’t even go to church during that frightening summer. Wise parents kept their children from playing with all other children. </p><p>That business remained in that location for ten or more years, and when Mother changed businesses, Mrs. King’s daughter joined her, and it was still a well known shop for several more years. The King and Yandle Sewing Shop was located very near the Square in an old brick building that had a busy history, though I never heard many stories about it. The shop itself had been in business for several years and had a lots of customers. Mrs. King and my mother, but it had been there for some time because at first Mrs. King had another partner. The shop was housed on the second floor a very old but quite sturdy building owned by a very odd sort of person who was one of the most well known people in the city. She was Miss Sally Davis who was very rich, and very well known in Charlotte. She, herself, came once a month to my mother’s shop to collect the rent for the Sewing Shop, and she wore long black dresses that touched the tops of her black shoes, and she always wore a black hat. It had been years since any other woman wore an ordinary everyday dress that almost touched the ground. Hemlines were at that time almost always just below the knee for grown women, but Miss Sally did not mind being different. She was, of course, very rich, and very set in her ways, and she came each month to the sewing shop to collect the rent money. garment that almost touched the one roomon rented the room on the second floor of a building really close to the Square. That building doesn’t exist now, but back then it was very near a major department store owned by the Belk family, and years later several more buildings were removed and a marvelous performing arts building was built in its place. the building was torn down, leaving an empty space for a long while. Eventually a large portion of old buildings in that area were that space was place does not exist called King and Yandle Sewing Shop. The name was written in red letters painted on the window which opened onto East Trade Street. The building was owned by a lady named Miss Sally Davison the Second Floor window of an old brick building on East Trade Street. Mrs. King had once lived next door to us, but that was when I was very young, and I didn’t remember the lady at all, though my sister had played with the King children when they lived near each other. </p><p>When School began in September, Mother stopped being only a wife and mother. She stopped being just a Mother and a keeper of the house. She began to work up town in a sewing shop making dresses for ladies who couldn’t sew and preferred a garment made for them instead of buying one off a rack in one of the stores. The shop where she worked was in an old brick building very close to the Square on East Trade Street. Several buildings on Tryon Street and those that were near the corner on Trade Street were torn down to make way for the Performing Arts Center that occupies that space today. However, in the 1930’s the old brick building owned by Miss 9999999 had several small shops on the first floor, and a number of second and third floor offices or spaces that were used by Belk’s Department Store as a sort of attic storage space for the men’s store, and perhaps other departments as well. On the second floor there were some small businesses such as seamstresses who made clothing to order, and a beauty parlor, and a photographer, and perhaps other businesses that I didn’t know about, because I never ever walked down the third floor hallway, though I realized that there were some people who worked up there. Wthat was torn down when a large auditorium was built for the performing arts. . The first floor of the building was two very small stores, and one of them was the Belk Brother’s Men’s Store. which was the very center of Charlotte where Trade Street and Tryon Street crossed each other. just a littlwith a wide open doorway that led to a very tall staircase that turned a corner near the top, and led to a dingy hall. Along the wide hallway at the top of the stairs were lots of doors on both sides of the hall, and most of them were either empty, or they were rented by the Belk Men’s Store as a storage place for their merchandise. It always seemed strange to me, but once I had climbed all the stairs and passed only one business which was run by one lady who was also a seamstress </p><p>The building that housed the King and Yandle Sewing Shop was owned by one of Charlotte’s real, honest to goodness, oddball. Her name was Miss Sally Davis, and she was not married. She was also very rich, and owned a lot of the property on Trade and Tryon streets. She had a big house, and wore clothes that were exactly right in the late 1800’s and her style stayed exactly and precisely the same for the rest of her life. Very few women wore skirts that almost touched the ground, but Miss Sally did. Her black shoes were always shiny, and her hair always pulled straight away form her face, and into a bun. She always wore a hat—a black hat—on top of her head. She was very thin, and when I was about twelve I thought she was silly to walk around town collecting money. She was small enough for a thief to grab her money and run—but that was the brave Miss Sally, who seemed to have outlived all her family, and who now alone attended to her business in person, and was well known to important persons as well as the ordinary folk who pointed to her, and quietly told their companions that they were noticing Miss Sally Davis, the strange old spinster lady who owned most of the real estate in uptown Charlotte. </p><p>brick on East Trade Street next door to Martin’s Department Storehad a job, and she made sure that I knew the way to the place she was working. Of course I did, but I knew the way from home to her shop, but not from the school to her shop. So I walked the nearly three blocks from school to my house, passed my house and didn’t stop there, and continued to walk uptown, as I had been taught by my mother. It was eleven blocks from our house. </p><p>The rest of the afternoon was both boring at times, and exciting at other times. The sewing shop was a one room business with two ladies, two sewing machines, a huge tall table that Mother and Mrs. King used to cut out garments, and there was a “stand” which actually wasn’t very large, but it was interesting to me. It had spools of thread of almost every color and hue stuck on nails along the length of the stand, and to my delight the top was not altogether level, but stepped so that it was easy to place or remove thread from the skinny little nails. I played with those spools, and rearranged them, placing all blues of many hues together, and all the greens, and all reds, and all browns—and happily amused myself until Mother and Mrs. King put away their sewing, and we all left the shop. There were two windows that had a marvelous view of East Trade Street, and the intersection that was called “the Square.” I could see city busses come and go, and traffic moving along both Trade and Tryon Streets, and it was wonderful to watch parades march through the Square without having to be in the crowd. The Fire Department was several blocks away on East Trade Street, and the Fire Chief usually went to every fire, so that several times a day that red car with a screaming serine would rush up the street, and I thought it was wonderful that it was the only car that could turn either right or left from Trade street onto Tryon Street. Drivers were not allowed to turn at that intersection, except for the fire chief, or the fire trucks. </p><p>The building that housed the King and Yandle Sewing Shop was owned by one of Charlotte’s real, honest to goodness, oddball.

For one thing, I moved from an old school that had been I doubted had looked as if it had never been refurbished, seldom been been there for </p><p>appearances, if you don’t count the newsworthy job of choir director in fairly small churches, or the occasional role of Sunday school teacher. Very few of my efforts have caused people to notice me. Nevertheless, my children, my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren might one day want to know a bit more than the history books tell about the past, and about our family. They may want to know more precisely how life was lived when I was young. I now wish with all my heart that I knew more about the lives of my parents when they were growing up. Was the world very different then, than it was when I was growing up? Is the Twenty-first Century very different from the Twentieth Century? The answer is that of course life and the living of it changes tremendously from one era to the next, and with my own experiences I can truthfully say that I came from horse and buggy days into the era when men walked on the moon, and I have seen many of the early wonders of the Twenty-first Century. </p><p>During the lives of my grandparents, as well as the lives of my parents, life truly was extremely different than life today. My Twentieth and Twenty-first century grandchildren would be horrified if suddenly they no longer had television, radios, electric lights, other electric conveniences including computers, especially air conditioning, and running water. They would have been appalled to find no indoor toilets, nor bath tubs, and that baths were taken from a smallish sized wash pan, and clothes were washed outdoors in a black iron pot that required a fire under it to boil the clothing and bed linens clean. There were no dryers, therefore the laundry had to be hung on a line to dry. They would especially hate the entire idea of having a kitchen sink that drained, not into a drain pipe rapidly and quickly out of sight, but into a bucket set carefully just beneath a short, dripping pipe and into an open bucket sitting on the floor, one that had to be carried outside to be emptied in a place where it would not create an easily visible mess. There was in those days no nice drain pipe that would carry away waste water. There was no garbage disposal, nor was there a weekly pick up of garbage and trash. Garbage not fit for the pigs or chickens to eat were either buried or burned, and trash was also usually burned. Not much that could be used in some way was ever treated as garbage. Torn sheets or clothing became dust rags or cleaning rags, and almost anything that was once edible but not actually consumed at the table at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, was usually poured into a slop bucket that would be fed to the pigs. In the late 1890’s and well into the early 1930’s, food left on plates, or dabs of vegetables not eaten were fed to the pigs, along with other garbage such as potato peelings, or slightly rotten tomatoes or small portions of foods left over from meals and too small to serve again were not sent to the garbage can, but were taken to the hog pen, and fed to the critters that would eventually be the pork to be placed on the dining table after the pigs were killed and cooked. Trash was usually burned in a place where a fire would not threaten fields or houses, or barns; however, little that could be used for much of anything was ever thrown away. </p><p>To cook, even in summer, the stoves had to have a fire burning in one end, and all hot water would have come from a small reservoir accessed from a trap door at one end of the iron stove top. The fire made the kitchen extremely warm in summer, but in winter the warmth was appreciated, as there was em, sinks . Yet manual typewriters were novel when I was a child. Radio was in its infancy. My family didn’t even have a telephone until I was eleven or twelve years old. There were no real antibiotics when my sister and I were children. Sulfa was about the only medication that could actually fight some illnesses, and that was not always either available or effective. </p><p>Six years before my birth, my mother’s first born was delivered at home, and at the age of six my sister was aware that some little girls wore store bought clothes, while she, herself, wore home made garments. She must have thought their dresses were quite lovely, as she seemed jealous of their wardrobe. On top of that, she discovered that she had been born at home, but the new baby had been born in Presbyterian Hospital—and that sounded like a place that was much more fancy than a home birth, so she resented me, and particularly hated doing anything at all for me. Her angry attitude toward me didn’t truly go away until I was about twelve years old. id did not even go to the hospital for the birth. Ella Cornelia was six, when I was born, and somehow she got it into her head that she was a “home-made” baby and I was “store bought” and that was part of the reason she disliked my arrival so very much. It took a little more than ten years to convince her that Mother and Daddy hadn’t played a dirty trick on her by having another child, and that they didn’t like me better than they liked her. </p><p>Life in this year—2006—is widely different than life when my sister was born in November of 1925. I entered the world about six years after she did, in February of 1931. 999999999999999999From the days when I was an infant, the lives of working people and the way people live in the Twenty-first Century is so very different form the way my grandparents lived that it could be the description of another planet. When my grandparents were children there were stories about people like one of my Dad’s uncles who, in his older years, had to admit that he had been married four times. The first three wives died in childbirth. He had more than twenty children, all of them at home, the evening my Dad at supper with them. His relatively young wife had prepared the meal. My Dad’s uncle, though I don’t remember his name, told my Dad that the happiest time of his life was when all his children were still at home, and the entire family would sit at table at meal time. </p><p>and a goodly portion of life is much improved simply because both information and communication are greatly improved, education is much more wide spread, and medicine, itself, has changed and lengthened lives. Then there are gadgets and inventions, whether whimsical or unexpectedly life-changing, that are not only available, but are in daily use to reduce the drudgery of house cleaning, and the monotony of washing dishes, but more important there are the changes and victories that medicine and treatments of today have mastered. </p><p>When I was born early in the year 193l the Great Depression had devastated our entire country, beginning first in the Northern States and then seeping down into the South. Banks closed because depositors withdrew their accounts until there was no more money in their cash drawers. Banks who had no funds in their vaults could no longer accommodate their depositors who expected to withdraw their own money from the bank. People who suddenly discovered that businesses were closing causing widespread unemployment, and banks that were had closed their doors, people were no longer able to pay their bills, or their rent, or their mortgage payments. The result of that was that unpaid mortgages caused foreclosures after which people living in the homes they had been buying were evicted, and most of them had no other place to go unless they had kinfolk who had farms, where they could at least grow their own food. Banks, without weekly or monthly deposits from wages and facing heavy withdrawals from unemployed people, simply closed their doors. Businesses of all sorts closed because their stock was depleted and they could not pay for more merchandise, and others which closed because they either had no customers, or because they could no longer replenish their shelves nor pay their workers. With owners and workers from small businesses finding themselves without income, and larger businesses suddenly discovering they had few customers who could pay immediately, discovered also that their profits were drastically reduced or non-existent. More and more people had no income. The failure of the banks wiped out countless nest eggs that had been prudently laid by in what people had believed was a safe place. </p><p>Unpaid wages and failed banks meant that people could not pay rent or mortgages; it also hindered buying groceries, or medications. Within the City of Charlotte citizens who were unable to pay the costs of electricity and water found those amenities discontinued. Sometimes folks who lived in the country where water came from springs or wells, and food could be grown in their own gardens, would invite relatives or close friends to share their homes until jobs were again available, and that was usually a wonderful relief for those families, but generally played havoc with relationships that were immediately too close for real comfort. Unfortunately not everyone had parents or cousins, or aunts, uncles, or loving friends who could help them. The Salvation Army was quite active in those days, much appreciated, and a sturdy pillar when the sky was falling in on almost everybody. There were very few “safety nets” beneath ordinary, hard working, and honest people. Almost every worker in the entire nation was affected. No job—no pay—no food—no shelter—no answers—no hope. </p><p>Since banks had closed, no access to savings meant no money at all. City people often moved in with home folks who had a farm, or parents who could offer shelter. Some who lost their livelihood had friends, close relatives, or even distant cousins who could help them. But there were many persons who had no job, no home, and no friend or family able, or perhaps willing, to help them. Most of those folk had to depend on agencies or churches, or the blessed Salvation Army where the homeless could usually get a meal, or shelter, and perhaps a cot inside a building to sleep on. </p><p>I, myself, remember that during the early years that my family (Dad, Mother, Sister, me) lived on West Eleventh Street, there were knocks on our kitchen door, usually close to lunch time, or between lunch and supper, and there at the bottom of our porch steps was a man in shabby clothing, asking if we could spare food, as he was hungry. Homeless men regularly camped along railroad tracks, sleeping in lean-tos made of bits and pieces of wood and cardboard, building fires in barrels, and trying not to arouse attention, or to cause any incident that would end with meeting policemen. Within the city the railroad right-of-ways offered some privacy for the homeless since most city housing had at least a little space, usually separated by a barrier of bushes and trees, between the streets and the railroad right-of-way because of the noise of the trains as well as the soot from the engines that were at that time using coal to produce steam in their boilers. </p><p>There were at least three railroad companies serving Charlotte in those years. One was well away from our house, and was a short line that hauled mostly people who traveled into and out of Charlotte every day across the Catawba River. For close to fifty years my Great Uncle Renus was the engineer on that local line, however, most of his riders knew him as “Johnny”, and most of his daily commuters correctly believed he was their friend. There were two other much larger railroad companies that came through Charlotte, and both had tracks quite near our house on Eleventh Street, causing two very different problems for my family. The problem was not whistle noise, as we didn’t mind the frequent whistles when the engine crossed city streets. However, back then the trains used steam engines with black smoke bellowing from the smoke stack. In winter, when we had cool and slightly damp days or, frequently at sundown on winter evenings, falling soot from passing trains was expected. Soot fell, not only from trains, but also from nearby chimneys. Electric dryers had been invented, but I didn’t know a single person who owned one until after I was married. The penalty of leaving clothes on the line after sundown in cold weather was to be vulnerable to falling soot and the threat of having to re-wash and re-dry every garment, towel, sheet, and handkerchief before we could use them. </p><p>Railroads produced another situation that affected city people who lived within a few blocks of the tracks. During all the years we lived on West Eleventh Street in Charlotte, we sometimes had back-door visitors. Because my mother couldn’t bear the idea of people actually going hungry, we were subject to visits from hobos. Both the Southern Railroad and the Norfolk and Southern tracks were only about two blocks away, and the right-of-ways of the tracks were only a few feet from the roadbeds of the city streets or even of houses and businesses built quite near the tracks. Bushes and trees would offer some softening of the noise of the engines and the clack-clack of rolling box cars, gondolas, and/or passenger cars, but the noise was there, and people who lived close to the tracks eventually simply endured the noise, and were rarely perturbed by the sounds. Since so many trains passed near us, we never checked our watches or clocks by the noise. </p><p>There was, however, one sound to which we did pay attention. There was a factory not far form our house that had three shifts of workers every day of the year. Their day was divided into three eight-hour shifts, and it sounded at Seven o’clock in the morning, Three in the afternoon, and Eleven o’clock every evening, seven days a week. We often depended on the hoots to time our own actions. The hoot at 7:00 AM meant if I wasn’t already out of bed, I’d better hurry it up. The Three O’clock hoot meant school was out, and in the evenings I had better be in bed when the last whistle of the day sounded at 11:00 PM. </p><p>The noise of neither mill nor trains was bothersome; however, the trains did affect us, especially in winter, though it wasn’t the noise. We washed our clothes in hot water in a tin tub, using a scrub board for stubborn dirty splotches, and then rinsed them in cold water. Then we wrung them by hand as dry as we could. The next step was hanging the clothes on a line in the back yard to dry in the sun. Woe to the neighbor kid who ran across our yard under our wet clothes leaving dirt on freshly washed clothes. We didn’t wash clothes on a rainy day. In winter when we had to heat the inside of the house, we had to do the wash as early as possible, because near sundown the air grew cooler, people stirred up their fires and their chimneys belched soot that would rain down on roofs and on clean clothes hung on a clothes line, too. We endeavored to always have our washing safely off the line well before sundown. If we were late, we would probably need to wash the clothes again, or wear soot spotted clothes. Some, or perhaps most, of the soot came from the train engines which still burned coal in those days. As the sun disappeared particles of smoke fell like rain. Soot fell routinely onto and around our house as there were two tracks from two different railroads that passed within two blocks of our house.<br/> 88888888888888888888888888 From our house we could hear the chug and clanks of the engines and cars of the trains, as well as the whistles of the engines when they were near a street crossing. Another constant noise was of motor traffic not only on our street, but also on Graham Street, a block the streets near us. West Eleventh Street which ran in front of our house connected to two separate streets that were eventually entries to, or exits from, the City of Charlotte. We were four blocks from North Tryon Street, a major thoroughfare, and less than a full block from heavily traveled North Graham Street. Eleventh Street was not only a corridor between those streets, but also could allow traffic to connect to streets that pointed eastward. Traffic along Eleventh Street was usually both heavy and fast, despite speed limits. By the time I was in the second or third grade it was dangerous to cross Eleventh Street traffic increased became heavier, faster, and somewhat more dangerous. fast, em. uched Tryon Street which was a North-South corridor, and less than a block from our house Eleventh intersected Graham Street which, in one direction intersected with Trade Street, and in the other direction intersected with Statesville Road. We had a great deal of traffic that included not only automobiles, but long haul tractor-trailers, so that our street was seldom without traffic. There was a time from the early forties to somewhere in the late fifties that we didn’t like to go to the movies until after the wreck at the corner of Eleventh and Pine Streets, and we had at least one nearly every Saturday afternoon. The only one that had been genuinely entertaining was the time no one was hurt, but a taxi overturned. Quickly, but seven people crawled through a back window to get out of that taxi and the last one was on crutches. Understand, we didn’t look at it as entertaining, and upon occasion we even drove people to the hospital, but wouldn’t you find it—well, at least unusual—for seven grown people with one on crutches to crawl through a window from the back seat of a taxi? </p><p>The Square was the center of Charlotte. It was where the first two main streets crossed each other, right in the middle of Charlotte’s downtown area. Tryon and Trade streets intersected, and that intersection was called the Square. . We were eleven blocks from the Square. Our t section of Charlotte rarely had quiet streets. These were thoroughfares with long-haul trucks as well as automobiles heading for the center of town. Tryon Street was three blocks away from our house, and Trade was only a couple of blocks further which and Graham the centerOur street connected two roads, Tryon Street, and Graham Street, that seemed to go the same direction, but actually lead to different cities, and that made our street a busy, heavily traveled road. We could also hear the whistles and puffs of train engines from two railroads, both about two blocks from our house. . sound of the engine of the one of which at that point, ran North-South parallel to Graham Street, and another, the Norfolk-Southern tha ran within two blocks of our house. One of them ran North-South along the track near our , one track ran east to west, and the other from north to south. Those men knocked at our back door, and asked for food, thanking us for whatever we gave them. </p><p>to the west, and one to the north of our home. the not far from our house.

This allowed ing nature itself to replenish that area so that it could be used again after a reasonable intervalwhen it had to and left the areas they had inhabited for relatively short periods almost as it was when they found it. </p><p>Then people came from England and Europe and other countries around the Mediterranean Sea. Soon after they landed on the Eastern shores of North America they started cutting down trees, for houses, plowing the land, killing the animals who had roamed there, and congregating in areas that became cities. Their presence, unlike that of the Indian Tribes, was as permanent as possible, and that single difference changed what we call “Mother Nature” in the process. </p><p>Those early folk who crossed the Atlantic from Britain, Ireland, and also from the Continent of Europe, were few at the beginning, but they grew in numbers, and kept increasing in numbers and spreading away from their origins across the sea to the newly discovered continent we call North America. Spain concentrated on the southern part of North America, and also filtered into the Southward extension of South America. ards Europeans usually came ashore above the equator. Spaniards seemed to move more to the South, and settled in South America. , moving both North and South along the coast, and westward, away from the sea, spreading and exploring, often following rivers that emptied into the Atlantic. As goods, tools, people, and animals like horses and cows arrived in North America, groups of people moved west as well as south. In the earlier years there was plenty of space to settle along the Easter Shores of the Atlantic. Eventually, people explored, moving always away from already claimed land into unclaimed areas, and in those areas the Government of the United States allowed people to “claim” home places, if they would build homes and farm or ranch on a specific measure of land. , or otherwise use the land to the betterment of the new country that was eventually called the United States of America. Most of the time people could claim a certain measure of land, build a house of some sort, and farm, or perhaps breed cattle, or a little of both, for a specified number of months or years, and the land would be theirs, to keep for themelves or their children, or sell in order to claim their farms, their estates, their ranches, their farms, their towns, their ranches, and always wherever the people expanded their ownership, somewhere near by there would be a town of sorts. It doesn’t really take a lot of people to make a town. Once—and only the one time—Bobby and I drove westward from North Carolina across a great part of our nation, as far north and west as Oregon, and then we drove south almost to the Mexican border, and then turned eastward again, aiming across the country toward home. as far south .

A little later The Pacific Ocean brought people to the West Coast of North America from China, and Southern Africa the relatively, and somewhat later those who came aross. Those folk were brave, yes, but many of them were desperate, also, because life in what is now Great Brittan and Europe, as well as North Africa and the Middle East, had for centuries often been interrupted by wars, famines, plagues, droughts, wars, floods, ignorance, and greed. All of those things were the result of strong, warlike peoples of many different sorts, from either close or distant countries who endeavored to subdue the original inhabitants in order to seize their land, their possessions, and sometimes make slaves of those people who survived the attack. their many different places within this world, most of whom always wanted more—more of whatever seemed good to them—land, water, food, trees, meat animals, fish, cozy homes, the good things that made pleasant living without the drudgery of working from early dawn to late evening. Everyone wanted good lives with as small a degree of effort as possible. People living, and suffering from droughts, wars, invasions, illnesses that killed, floods, selfish rulers, all wanted an easier life. Always, everywhere, the peaceful and plentiful years were wonderful. However, there were always either small or extensive wars, crowded and unsanitary cities, changing seasons, occasional climate changes, sudden destructive storms, and at intervals, discovery of iscoveries of unclaimed lands beyond current boundaries, and growing knowledge of ways to travel, and which often changed, and the powers that waxed and waned in cities, countries, and built cities, countries, and nations and then fought wars that depleted their holdings and destroyed their homes and fields, the European, African, Asian continents fought wars, built and destroyed cities, and, and eventually rebuilt cities and nations that repeated that cycle and were eventually overrun and destroyed during wars or famines.

Our government has tried and for the most part has achieved new decisions that will help solve problems, or stem the flow of a bad idea, or uplift a new and marvelous solution—but it also at times falls short of a good decision, or allows itself to be twisted into a situation that spoils rather than relieves a situation. What was it the poet said? “The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.”</p><p>Men like Abraham Lincoln achieved great changes for the good of our country, and others also did their best. Some strive to achieve a change in precepts cognizant of what is truly best for our nation, like Abraham Lincoln who abolished slavery. However, there have been laws, or methods, or decisions made by persons who hold important offices that I wish had been left undone. One of those rulings that I wish could be undone is the one that banished God’s Word from schools, and took prayer away from the classroom. Another is the depraved notion that persons of the same sex can be husband and wife. </p><p>I am a person who literally, and I mean actually, came from horse and buggy days into an era that has seen men walking on the moon, and lives extended by medical treatments not even dreamed of during the years when I was a child. My Grandparents would have benefited had certain medications been available when they grew old. My Dad’s sister wouldn’t have lost all her teeth at the age of eighteen had her physician truly understood the damage his “medicine” would do to her teeth. The medicine didn’t actually help her illness; however, since she did swallow the potion her physician mixed up for her, the medicine removed the enamel from her teeth, causing pain, so that well before she reached her twentieth birthday she had no teeth. Of course she eventually did have false teeth that served her well. Did the fact that she had false teeth so early actually affect the rest of her life? Add to that unhappy problem, Aunt Helen, as the oldest daughter, at an early age assumed the kitchen duty, particularly because her Mother was, to some extent, quite frail. Her sister Martha, about two years younger, had almost always helped with chores within the house, but for a while when she was in her late teens, she was enrolled in the School of Nursing at Presbyterian Hospital, hoping that her training would prove helpful for her mother. Unfortunately, Aunt Martha began to have medical difficulties of her own which made surgery necessary, and while she was ill, and recovering from the surgery, she could not rejoin her nursing class. Though her training had been interrupted, she had learned a lot about nursing, and it helped her to deal with caring for her mother who was frail. Her mother’s most difficult problem was a disease called eyeritis. Tragically there was no cure for that sickness, and my grandmother became blind. she became quite ill, and . A huge portion of her life was devoted to nursing her mother who eventually became completely bedridden. </p><p>Apart from birthing six children, Grandmother had an illness named eyeritis. The illness caused painful inflammation of the eyes, and it blinded her. She could tell bright daytime from dark, however bright lights made her eyes hurt, and she needed to put drops in her eyes often to reduce discomfort. She did not really see my sister as an infant, and she never saw me until one Sunday afternoon when I was in my early teens. I was sitting very close to her on a low footstool, and the late afternoon sun seemed to shine directly on my face from an open window. I moved a little, and Grandmother Yandle told me to resume my former position because she could see me. Those in the room heard her, and they called my sister who changed places with me, but the magic moment vanished, and Grandmother could not see her. </p><p>Mother told me that Grandmother Yandle was stricken with a disease called eyeritis which caused her to be blind, however, I don’t know what year she suffered that loss of vision, and I think it was before 1925 because she told once told me she had never seen either my sister, Ella Cornelia, nor me, even as babies. There was no cure and no effective medicine for that illness at that time. Sadly, there has not been a breakthrough as yet for a cure for eyeritis, as quite recently, in November of 2006 Paw-Paw and I were asked to pray for a lady who was recently diagnosed with the problem, and who was told that there is not yet a remedy. In the year 2006—about 85 years since my Grandmother was stricken and blinded by that illness, there is no real help in overcoming eyritis. You either get better, or you lose some measure of your sight. We can rejoice that there are many illnesses that seldom, or even never, appear in this day and time, thanks to antibiotics and clever effective treatments. However, there are still illnesses for which there is not yet a cure. </p><p>My first five years of life were from 1931 to 1936, and there is very little that I remember from those years. In 1931 my family lived on East Fifth Street in Charlotte, North Carolina. Straight across the narrow street from our rented house was the house owned by my Great-Uncle Edward Yandle and his sister, my Great-Aunt Elizabeth Yandle. One day, after I was married and actually after Louise, our first child, was born, my mother told me a story. I think we may have been discussing the washing diapers and hanging them out, because for me there was a difficulty as I had no clothes line. Mother smiled and almost giggled. Then she told me that when my sister was quite young their young family was living upstairs in the house owned by Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward. My sister was old enough to sit alone, and on this occasion Mother had carried her onto the back porch and placed her in her sturdy high chair for safe keeping while she herself went into the back yard to hang her washing on the clothesline to dry. The porch was quite advanced in design as it was protected from bugs by screening, and also somewhat shaded by lattices. Mother could see through the lattices somewhat, but not clearly, though she could hear her little girl should she cry. </p><p>While Mother quickly penned her wet laundry to the line to dry she could clearly hear her little girl, but it was more difficult to see her through the lattice and screen. Mother was pleased to hear her little girl giggle and chuckle despite the fact that she was alone on the porch. Mother was, of course, pleased that Ella Cornelia was entertaining herself.</p><p>She was less pleased when, finished with her chore in the yard, Mother returned to the porch and discovered what had entertained her little darling, making her laugh. It seems that Aunt Lizzie had a prized fern that hung from the ceiling of the porch where it could get sunlight, and the large plant was flourishing with green leaves and health, adding a bright fresh green presence on the porch. Little Ella Cornelia had liked it, also, and, unfortunately had been well within reach from her high chair. She had discovered that if she caught and pulled at the stems of the fern, the little leaves would fall off and float to the floor, making a green carpet around her chair, which pleased her so much she laughed to see them float from her fingers to the floor. </p><p>Mother laughed at the memory. I laughed with her, and never learned what Aunt Lizzie had to say about the denuding of half her prize fern. </p><p>Living with Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward would, in my opinion, have been a little difficult, because I knew Uncle Edward, and Aunt Lizzie, and I though they were very, very different from most people. Later in my life I realized I was totally correct. Lizzie and Edward were the offspring of my Great Grandfather and, I decided, they must have been children of his second wife because they were much younger than my Grandfather. I’m not sure where Lizzie and Edward were born, but they definitely did not have any Southern Drawl in their speech. Their pronunciation of words was different as was their vocabularies, and the phrasing of their remarks and mannerisms were vastly different from that of my family who had lived and grown up in the South. As proof of my guess about their childhood, I do recall one visit made by Uncle Edward when I was about five years old. </p><p>It was meal time, and our family—Father, Mother, Sister, and me—were at the table having lunch. Uncle Edward, who made his living being a door to door salesman of items people often forgot when they went shopping. He sold small items like shoe strings, remedies like balms for aches and pains, small, but needed items that people in a hurry might forget to purchase in a department store, or a grocery store. He carried his wares in what I called his “suitcase,” knocking on doors, taking orders in a few cases, or producing what was needed on the spot. He was actually well known in most Charlotte neighborhoods, as he had been offering his goods to housewives for many years. That day must have been a Saturday, as my Dad was at home for lunch. We came when called to the meal, and had just begun to eat when Uncle Edward arrived at the front door. Since he felt quite at home in our house, he simply walked in the front door, and into the kitchen. My mother asked him if he would like to eat lunch. Uncle Edward replied, “I have no room.” </p><p>Of course, the four of us had taken our usual chairs around the table, and Uncle Edward was right, there wasn’t any room for him at the table. Quickly Mother rearranged our seating, laid a place for Uncle Edward, and again invited him to join us at the table. He chuckled, remembering how he had answered my mother when she had first invited him to join us at the table. He did take the place mother had laid for him, but he chuckled as he sat down, explaining that his remark had been misunderstood. “I meant,” said he, “that I have no room in my alimentary canal.” However, he sat with us in the place Mother had set for him.</p><p>I have no real memory of living on East Fifth Street, though I know that until I was about three years old my Dad had rented a house across the street from Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward. I do saw the outside of that house every time we visited Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward, which was probably at least once a month during my childhood. Of that house I have only mind pictures of the front porch, and a dark place that frightened me. During a nostalgic conversation with my sister she told me that my memory of shadows on the floor of the porch came from the solid half wall that enclosed it, but had small arches at the floor level to allow rain to run off the porch. The other recollection was of a dark and threatening enclosed space from which I could not escape. She told me that at the back door of the house there was a small entry way which had four doors, and nothing else. One led to the outside, and the other three led into different parts of the house. She told me that one day when I as two or three years old, I entered that space and the door closed behind me. I stood in total darkness and screamed until someone rescued me. </p><p>Within my small world which was peopled mostly by my parents, my sister, and the often visited Grandparents, aunts and uncles, and occasionally by friends of my parents, also only somewhat with our neighbors. I saw few children my own age. My world was not very large, and had always been blessed with love. My sister had not been happy when I was born. </p><p>once in a whilethere was As I was growing up there were great changes in the field of Medicine, and the medications available. There were vaccinations, and I had never heard of anyone else being afflicted with that disease. My mother said that it was a rare disease, and that not many people had it. That it was rare was even having such a sickness until I was grown and already a grandmother, myself. We were among the members of the Methodist Church we were attending at that time when the members were asked to pray for a young woman in her late twenties who had just been diagnosed as having Eyeritis—inflammation of the eye, for which there was no cure. That was . She had She did very well, and soon the illness went away without a significant change in her vision. It was fairly close to a miracle that she had not suffered a permanent loss of vision, because there was not yet, at that time, any real treatment or medication for that illness, and that incident was about forty-five years ago. Because so many wonderful drugs have been discovered and we are all so very blessed in this country to have the great number of medications to help us keep our health, to avoid sickness, and in this there are marvelous medications that are now in use; however, that particular illness does not yet have a cure, as only today (2006) I received a request from our Prayer Group to pray for a young woman who was just diagnosed with that infection. We, as a nation, or as a people the world over have not yet found a cure for all of the rather terrible health problems that harm people all over the world. However, we should thank God, and those persons who have worked, sometimes endangering themselves, to find a cure for diseases that can leave its victims with dire difficulties. </p><p>When I was a child there were very few curatives for the wide number of illnesses that were common in most areas of the United States. Some illnesses were, when I was a child, actually reported to the Health Department—a part of the government—and warning signs were affixed to the door of the house where the ill person resided as a warning to everyone who approached the door. This would prevent folk from entering the house without being warned, risking their becoming ill, too. 99999999999999999999999</p><p>health that persons or at least one person, was suffering with a contagious disease, and those who had not yet had that disease could s resided in that house. Those signs were generally nailed to a wall next to the door itself, and were garishly bright in color so that none could claim that the sign was not prominent. That protocol was to keep illness from spreading throughout a neighborhood. e , or arrived unexpectedly on the doorsteps without knowledge that those who entered the house would be exposed to a contagious illness. </p><p>, or should have been, quarantined to prevent spreading the sickness. at actually cured any disease. There were, of course, inoculations, that could reduce symptoms, or protect a person from illnesses like Smallpox, and when I was a child such vaccinations were required before children enrolled in school. Measles were communicable, and chicken pox, and other illnesses which required quarantines for a certain number of days. It was required by law in the City of Charlotte to report communicable diseases to the Health Department. Someone—usually a man when I was a child—who would arrive at our front door with a cardboard placard that announced the name of the illness, and the date when the quarantine would be lifted. For some illnesses the man from the Health Department had to return to remove the placard, and some placards could be torn down by the people who lived there. I remember the occasion when I could tear down a placard for measles, and with relish I reached up from my Dad’s arms and jerked that notice down, making it legal for visitors to come to our house again. which was easily communicable and deadly. Eventually other illnesses such as measles and chicken pox which now has disappeared entirely in this country, but which had frequent outbreaks when I was a child, have also disappeared. In Charlotte when a child had measles or chicken pox the Health Department came to the house and placed a card-board sign beside the door, warning visitors that entering the house was likely to cause illness for the visitor, or in his family. I can remember several occasions when that sort of card-board sign was on our door, because when it was legal to remove it, my mother or daddy held me up and gave me the pleasure of ripping it away from the weatherboard beside the door. </p><p>One of the most devastating illnesses when I was young was poliomyelitis, also called infantile paralysis. That illness was miss-named, though children were more likely to succumb to the sickness than adults. Adults did contract the disease, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the United States, was affected by that disease, and lost almost all of the use of his legs. He was elected President four times, and held his office until his death. During his presidency and for some years after that, there was a charity called the March of Dimes, and all over the United States people were asked to give at least a dime, or more, if they could afford it, to fund efforts to find a cure for the disease that struck both children and adults, and spread like an epidemic. The year I completed the fifth or sixth grade there was an epidemic of Polio in North Carolina. Schools in Charlotte were closed early that year. Youth’s and children were asked to stay at home, and not mingle with neighbors or regular playmates because Polio was so very contagious. Theaters had age limits, and could not admit young children. Parks were closed to children. Parents were asked to prevent their children from playing as usual with neighbors, and churches no longer held Bible School, or Sunday School classes for children during that summer. It was a lonely time for me, as my sister, being six years older than me, did not fall into the age group confined to their home. I was wearing braces on my teeth that summer, and I did keep my appointments with my orthodontist, but I didn’t ride the bus. I walked uptown, and didn’t go onto Tryon Street, a very busy and usually crowded street, until the last couple of blocks. My walk was only one mile to the Orthodontist’s office, with only a little over one block that was relatively crowded. However I didn’t mind walking the mile into townvery close to one mile in the summer heat, because the alternative was riding a bus, and my Mother didn’t want me to be enclosed with a bunch of other riders inside the bus. It was safer to walk alone, choosing streets that were unlikely to be crowded, the hot sun at least a mile on unshaded streets. I didn’t resent not riding the bus at all, as there was more space between me and persons who might be able to pass I knew the risk of becoming ill, and did not wish become ill. persons who had Polio might, but also might not, ever walk again, and there were some who had the disease and lived the rest of their lives using crutches, or lying on their backs inside a tank which breathed for them, because their lungs no longer functioned on their own. Some victims of the disease could, like President Roosevelt, walk with crutches, or live in a wheelchair. Many children and youths died from it, and most of those who lived through their illness spent the rest of their lives in a wheel chair, or on crutches, or worst of all, lying in an iron-lung that was a barrel like machine which enveloped the person except for the head. The person was alive, however, could not breathe for himself, or move his hands, or control his body in any way—it was as if only the head survived the illness, though the heart, and stomach seemed to function, not much else of the person’s body achieved movement either voluntary or involuntary. . Those stricken persons could not breathe without being encased in that barrel, with the rhythmic sound of motor that wheezed and clanked with every breath it “breathed” for him or her. head, because their muscles no longer worked, and they could not even breathe for themselves. The barrel-like “iron lung” had a motor that somehow helped them to breathe. </p><p>People below the age of sixteen, or perhaps eighteen that Spring before the planned end of the year, and parents were told to keep their children at home, and </p><p>were warned not to play together,which collected money from , though he used a wheel-chair after his illness. The President started a charity called the March of Dimes, and encouraged people all over the country to give to the organization which would devote its efforts to find a cure for Poliomyelitis. The actual cure did not surface that I know of, however, a vaccine to prevent the illness was discovered and it became mandatory for children to have the vaccine, and I think most adults were also vaccinated. After that national effort to prevent the disease, the illness became rare or not at all. , and though I can’t remember whether or not adults were compelled to tcan cause blindness beyon“old” age that still shows up today, suffered became blind when Helen was a young girl. She, as the oldest girl child, took over the household, preparing meals on a wood burning stove, coping with no water except that brought in from the well, and no outlet from the sink except for the bucket placed beneath the drain. The toilet was an outhouse and most of the food she cooked was grown on their farm. She kept chickens, and pigs, and preserved fruits and vegetables from their own trees, gardens, and fields. Aunt Helen did little in the gardens, because she had constant kitchen duties. She also was the chief “cleaner” of the house. During my early years I was accustomed to making use of every inch of the house we lived in, and I found it strange that the dining room and parlor of that house, both of which were beautifully furnished, were seldom used except for Christmas or the rare special occasion. I realized that use of those rooms in winter were difficult because it required extra fires that used up the wood needed to keep the kitchen and sitting room where my Grandmother lived, warm throughout the winter. The house had no electricity, no indoor toilet, and all water used in the house including the kitchen was drawn from the well. no running water. . which doubled as my Grandmother’s sick room </p><p>canned vegetables from the garpigs, , which had to be emptied by hand. She prepared the meals for her parents and siblings, helped to nurse her mother who was an invalid, and was always the one person who elected to stay at home with her mother, her father, and her brother Edward if her other two sisters left the house. Whether that played any part of her decision to settle into a life totally dedicated to simply keeping house for her parents with only one neighbor as a friend, , seeing no one beyond visitors to her parents, or members of her family. and she never married. </p><p>For instance, telephones were marvelously new to most of the people who lived in Charlotte, North Carolina, in the 1930’s. Of course the police had telephones, and the fire department had phones, and the building where the city, and the county governments were housed also had telephones. Businesses usually had phones, as did hospitals and doctor’s offices. Radio was also a prominent part of communication via news reports. Telephones had telephones. Only </p><p>, the police, the government folks, the people who had money to spend, doctors, businesses, and hospitals, ambulance companies (yes I meant ambulance companies to be plural, as most of the funeral homes, and there were several in Charlotte, handled ambulance calls, as well as companies that handled embalming and/or burials could also double as ambulances, and did so. also could Electricity within nearly every house in Mecklenburg County was still an unfulfilled wish. Schools, again, just those in use in Mecklenburg County, were, when I was born, very old. Some were actually so unsafe that they were no longer used as classrooms when I was growing up. There was no television. Moving Pictures existed, though most of them had no color, and were only black and white. Radio was a marvelous invention, and we had one at our house when I was about seven years old, because since my Dad was a Painting Contractor his customers needed to contact him. The city of Charlotte was still using trolley cars when I was a child. I actually rode on the last trip of the trolley car that passed my house on West Eleventh Street. My mother warned me to remember the experience because there would never be another, and I would be able to tell my children that I rode on that trip—and so that I could admit that I rode on the bus that passed my house when it was a true novelty to all the folk who lived on our street.</p><p>Remembrances of my early childhood are very sketchy indeed, mostly because I am now seventy-five years old, and that makes my childhood somewhat distant to today. When I was growing up my mother told me little stories about myself when I was very young, but I, myself, have only sketchy and uncertain memories of events that were actually important in my early life.</p><p>For one thing, I was born in 1931, and in the South, that was Depression time. The difficulties that began in 1929 and caused so much trouble in the North also affected the South. However, the total stoppage of jobs without hope of a quick recovery moved somewhat slower in the South than it did in the North. There were many more farmers and people who lived closer to the land than in the North. In the South there were mills and businesses that required employees, but there were also farms. Eventually the failure of the economy in the North reached into the South. Banks in the South failed, businesses closed, and people were out of work. Eventually the businesses in the South were caught up in the general alarm, and hundreds of people watched 9999999999999999999999their , and they, too, and the small businesses closed their doors, and the larger ones who had hoped for a jump start in the South discovered to their dismay that either closed their doors, or did smother the South and cause dreams to shatter along with the jobs, and , and I was told that it was immediate disaster in the northern part of the nation, when banks went bankrupt and businesses collapsed because there was no business, and no customers. Bank Accounts disappeared like water poured on sand. Money that had been horded against hard times simply disappeared. </p><p>. ” sometimes disappeared along with the banks, and could not be The South was not spared, and though people on farms could probably eat from their gardens life was rough everywhere. </p><p>ich continued toand that it seemed to strike with less haste, but with bitter and terrifying devastation in the lives of the people below the Mason Dixon Line. The fact that many people in the South were farmers, and could at least grow their food did not change the fact that banks had failed, and people who needed money had no access to savings that had been deposited into banks. People were certainly willing to work, but there were few jobs because many businesses had closed and people, for the most part, had no money to spend on much of anything. Banks closed, stores closed, other businesses closed. Most families were somewhat touched by the demise of businesses, or the closure of mills or other companies because they couldn’t pay their workers. businesses. People who had trusted banks to be a safe place to deposit savings discovered that the most honest bank could not had out all it’s assets and still remain in business.</p><p>Almost every working person one lost their jobs.

My sister was a full six, almost seven years older than me, and when I was growing up she disliked me so much she was mean to me if she had the chance. Once, when I was about six years old, my sister was angry with me, and since I had been left alone with her I had to obey her. She demanded that I cook my own eggs, and I didn’t know how to cook. Nevertheless, she badgered me until I tried to cook my eggs, and then she forced me to eat them. Strangely, I didn’t remember that particular problem. However, I have never liked eggs—except an occasional deviled egg. Perhaps that forced learning of how to cook my own eggs, though I don’t remember it at all, might have triggered my dislike of scrambled eggs. </p><p>And when she was ten or eleven, she had lots of chances. Of course I failed completely to understand why she was pleased if she could fuss at me, or make me do something I didn’t find pleasant, and I realized every time that she was happy to push that chore off on me. When I was a bit older I discovered that customs among my family were very tight lipped about the fact that a new baby would be joining the family. Of course the mother of that child had all the symptoms and the tell-tale shape that announced to the folk “in the know” that a new baby was on the way. When I was much older I learned that Ella Cornelia , who had been an only child for six years, came home after a visit with a neighbor, and found her mother holding a new baby. Suddenly, Ella Cornelia was not, truly NOT—the center of attraction in her own house. Both kin folks and neighbors came to visit, and they wanted to see the baby, not sweet little Ella Cornelia. People looked at the BABY. They didn’t pay nearly as much attention to young Ella Cornelia who hadn’t expected people to want to see the new little brat. Ella Cornelia seemed to be the only person in the world who had not expected such a thing. She had to accept the fact that the new kid took almost all her mother’s time. She, who had always been the center of attraction to her parents, and in the Yandle family as the only child, the only grandchild, and had always the center of the attraction. </p><p>Suddenly, there was a tiny baby that Mother held in her arms for hours—which meant that during the day no one was cuddling her. Not only that, but Mother asked her to fetch, or carry away, small necessities, while she just sat there, holding the baby. Ella Cornelia had not been told a child was on the way. She had no small hint of warning. The surprise was not shocking, not a happy revelation. </p><p>It was a custom in those days in many families to keep the secrets of how a mother managed to “have” babies and the truth was a total secret. If Mama gained a little weight, she trimmed herself back to normal while she nursed the new baby. Angels sometimes brought the new little ones, or they just appeared one day when any other children were suddenly sent away to visit Aunty for a day, and when they came back home there was a little baby that was an addition to the family. My entire existence was a tremendous shock to my sister, and it took a number of years to smooth over that shock. Her status her own home, as well as her Grandparents house, and even the neighbors, changed. That little baby was always taking so much of her mother’s time, causing Ella Cornelia to seem to be less important than the new child, being forced to stop her games to help fetch things while Mother held the baby. All of that kind of stuff was an insult to young Ella Cornelia. And it was adding insult to injury to require her to forfeit some fun thing because of that, that, that, baby. </p><p>There was another problem, too. A couple of years before I was born there was a dreadful event that changed many lives, thwarted many plans, and actually ruined the way people had lived for years and years. The Stock Market way up in New York collapsed. Banks held useless checks, but little actual money. People stopped visiting stores because they had no money to spend. Companies closed their doors because they had no customers, and customers who owed the stores money couldn’t pay because they had been “laid off” of their jobs because their bosses could no longer pay them as, they, too, didn’t have enough money. The banks and small businesses simply closed their doors and “went out of business.” People, who had used the money from their pay checks to buy food, suddenly couldn’t buy food because they had no jobs. Many businesses simply closed, and the workers were all out of a job. All of the people who used their salaries to pay for a roof over their heads and food for their tables, suddenly had no salary, no home, no food, and not very much hope of finding another job. </p><p>In the northern part of the United States the difficulties began in 1929. The Northern States had more large businesses than the South, and suddenly businesses in the North were closing. That meant that people who worked there suddenly didn’t have jobs, and then the banks that had taken deposits suddenly didn’t have any money to repay their patrons when they wanted to withdraw money. Suddenly businesses whose customers had no money couldn’t function, and their doors were closed. People went to the place where they worked, but found the doors locked against them, so that there was no pay check, even if one was owed. Almost everyone was affected by this terrible event. Businesses closed. Working people discovered their jobs had ended. People who had purchased anything on credit suddenly could no longer make payments since they had lost their jobs. People who had bought homes on credit—paying a little on each payday—were suddenly unable to make the promised payments. Rich people who had invested in the Stock Market were suddenly broke because the Stock Market collapsed. Formerly “rich” people couldn’t pay their electric bills, or their water bills. Because banks had paid out almost all the money in their vaults, they closed their doors. People said that the banks had failed and that was true. The banks could not return to their customers the cash they had deposited on their last visit. Banks simply closed their doors. </p><p>Without the failure of banks that had supposedly been the safest place to keep money, along with failed businesses that were forced to close because no one was doing business with them, people could not pay rent, or buy groceries, or make promised payments toward loans. Landlords have rarely been known as folk who accept news such as “I don’t have the money right now” with a hearty laugh and a promise to see you later. People who lost their jobs and couldn’t pay their rent had to leave the houses or apartments they had been renting. </p><p>People who were suddenly without funds were terrified and angry. When rent or payments on loans became due most people had to “make other arrangements” which for the most part meant moving in with relatives if they could. They would have to move whether or not it was desirable, or making serious steps down hill where beauty and comfort and pleasure and most of all, privacy, were not part of the description of their new “quarters”. In most homes even food became scarce, and people actually did go hungry. Single people who had neither job nor welcoming kinfolks, were truly “out in the cold.” In those days there were Salvation Army people who could offer food, and perhaps a bed for the night, but during those years most cities and towns were well aware of homeless people, both men and women, and sometimes those folk would break a window just to be put in jail where it was at least warm.</p><p>Women without shelter would seek help from the Salvation Army, and sometimes men also depended on them for help. The Salvation Army did marvelous work during that time in our country’s history. One of the ways they announced the presence of help in a community was to send a group to a corner in a neighborhood or near a place where Hobo’s gathered. The Salvationists brought their accordions, and trumpets and drums along with a few singers, and usually a man with a strong voice who would preach a short sermon. They would stand just off the curb, and begin to play their instruments and sing. The hymns would bring nearby people to the corner, and they would often stand on the sidewalk to listen to the music and then the fairly short sermon that always ended with an opportunity for the un-churched to give their hearts to Christ.</p><p>About every Saturday afternoon a group of Salvation Army folk would gather, on the corner of North Graham Street and West Eleventh Street. They would make a shallow semicircle a little way from the curb—standing in the street. Some of the group would bring musical instruments, and others in the group would sing the hymns. The one who could talk loudest would urge the audience to join in with the songs, and if I knew the song, I would sing with them. Then one of the men would read from the Bible, and preach a short sermon, ending with an invitation to the audience to commit their lives to Jesus. Then there would be a prayer of benediction, and the crowd would leave. The Salvation Army people would go on their way. Almost every time that group came to the corner, one of the participants in the group was a lady who lived alone three doors down the street from my house. </p><p>I was expected to return home as soon as the Salvation Army folks put away their instruments, and I did precisely that. I seldom went into the café, but they sold ice cream, and sometimes I did buy a popsicle from Mr. Kanasas. </p><p>From Grade one all the way to the sixth grade I attended Bethune School, located on North Graham Street at Nineth . I could easily walk the four blocks to school—one block from my house to Graham Street, and Two blocks to Ninth Street where the Crossing Guard stood with his stop and go sign. Miss Belvin was my first grade teacher, and Bethune School was an old school. So far as I was concerned, the age of the school itself didn’t bother me. The floor of my room was a problem. It was very slick because it had been treated with some sort of oil, and both desk and chairs slid very easily on the floor. On the first day several children knocked over their chairs by accident and they made a very loud slapping sound when they fell backwards or sideward. If you spend much time around young children, you know that noise is like music to the ears of the active child, especially the male children. Eventually it became a game, and the teacher laid down a rule—if you turn your chair over, you must stand in a corner. I thought that was a great idea for those few little boys who plopped over their chairs for the fun of making a noise and making the little girls jump. The slaps of the falling chairs against the floor were sharp and disruptive for the class. Then came the moment when I left my chair, and when I returned it slipped out from under me and I fell and hit the floor with a bang. It hurt. I decided not to cry. However, the teacher did not run to me, help me up, nor did she ask if I was hurt. The truth was that the smack on my bottom when I fell did hurt. She simply ordered me to stand in a corner like a bad girl. I was outraged. She didn’t care if I was hurt. There I was, slapped onto the floor and hurting my bottom, and even though I got up by my self, righted my chair, and was going to sit down in it, without even crying though I was hurt, the teacher was going to punish me??? Not by the hair of my chiny, chin, chin. I couldn’t help it because her slick floor made my chair slip!! So I told her, “No! I didn’t mean to do it.” She told me again to stand in the corner. I said no. She told me again, and I told her I had not done it on purpose, and I wasn’t going to stand in the corner. I sat in my chair and did my work, and minded my own business. When I got home I told my mother. I never knew what the teacher thought of that. But I remembered how my dance teacher punished me when I had not done anything bad. I intended never to let someone treat me like a bad girl again. As a matter of fact, all of the rest of my journey through school I expected to be treated fairly, and none of my teachers accused me wrongly again. </p><p>You see, that had happened to me once in Kindergarten. Most of my classmates took tap dancing as part of the kindergarten curriculum. One day my teacher told the class that if the children were bad, they would have to sit out part of the lesson. I, you see, was a good girl. And I was doing my best to follow directions from my teacher. Suddenly, she told me to go sit in a chair. I asked her why. She said, “You know.” I said “What did I do wrong?” And she said “you know.” And I said again, “What”. And she became angry and sent me to sit in a chair. I truly had no idea why. It made me angry that she had not answered me. I didn’t cry, but I was angry about her punishment. I never did find out what I did, or what she thought I did, that was so wrong. However, that very day I decided no one would ever treat me like that again. I was really angry that the teacher would not at least tell me why I was being punished. </p><p>wenty or thirty day students who were taking four or five classes, and a few who were taking only one or two courses, mostly to complete studies and obtain a diploma. The majority of the students lived in dormitories and stayed on campus for months at the time, going home only on holidays. I commuted every day, riding on busses from West Eleventh Street to Myers Park area to attend classes. As a day student I never spent the night on campus except for two nights when I was part of the welcome committee for new students who were coming to Queens that fall as freshman students. The students (all girls at that time) who lived on campus had very nice rooms with two girls in each room. There were probably twenty or so “day students” who did not live on campus, some of them male, but the girls who lived in dormitories and seldom left the campus were the majority. More than half of the students mother and I would occasionally buy one plate for each of us for our lunch. The clientele of the café was mostly men, and most of them drank beer. Even so, because he knew who I was, I was never worried about some drunk deciding I should be nice to him. I always stood close to his cash register until he brought my plate, and I never looked about me to see who was there. There were not many women who came in the café alone, and I tried to stay right where Mr. Kanasas could see me unless he had his back to me. No lonely drinker ever said even one word to me, and because I was tall for my age there were times when I was waiting on the bus across the street from the café that some one who had stopped by the café decided I was waiting for him instead of waiting for the bus. . one in that café ever said even one word to salways enjoyed being there on the corner and singing with the group gathered there. on most evenings , and draw a crowd with their singing of hymns. There was a group of Salvation Army people who regularly sang at least once a week on the corner of Graham Street and West Eleventh, right outside a café run by a Greek man. </p><p>The man who ran the café was Dave Kanasas. He was born in Greece, and spoke with an accent that I found difficult to understand. His wife was American, and their three children had no accent. Since Charlotte’s city blocks in that area really were square, with the east/west streets numbered and the north/south streets named, The Kanasas café was on Graham Street, right on the corner of Eleventh Street and Graham. Our house was on Eleventh Street, almost on the corner where Eleventh and Pine met, and the Kanasas house was on Pine Street, with it’s back yard touching the back yard of my house. The Kanasas children were an older boy, a girl older than me but younger than my sister, and a little boy named Pete who was younger than me by a about a year and a half. </p><p>east/weHis café was on the corner of Eleventh Street and Graham Street. His house faced Pine Street, and his Café faced Graham Street. Every day he walked past our house, on Eleventh Street, to get to his Café. was only a block away from his Café, and faced Pine Street. until some of the folks put up fences, he could have walked from the Café’s back door across about four back yards, and been in his own yard, which touched our back yard. s café was on the corner of Eleventh and Graham Streets, His house faced North Pine Street, with the side of his back yard right against the back of our back yard. and our house fronted on Eleventh Street, but our back yards touched, and my Daddy rented a garage from Mr. Kanasas. Mr. and Mrs. Kanasas had three children, one boy about the same age as my sister, a girl who was younger than my sister, but older than me, and a little boy named Pete who was about a year or perhaps a little more than one year, younger than me. who lived right behind our hous<br/> Most of the homeless women would try to enter some sort of shelter, and the Salvation Army was active in most cities had such shelters for both men and women available. I am sure they had lots of people who depended on them, especially in cold weather. </p><p>Even with the help of the Salvation Army there were still a lot of people who were what my Dad called “bums”. They were given that name when they begged for food at someone’s door. A lot of the men simply camped even in winter along railroad tracks since most tracks had bushes or trees next to the right-of-ways, and because if they didn’t cause trouble, the railroads didn’t bother them. That way they had access to some place to sleep if they were able to build some sort of shelter, and since there were café’s and grocery stores, both of which had trash cans where they might find discarded edible foods and containers they could use to heat meals over fires. Households threw away torn clothes and old shoes and such, and those people could retrieve them and make use of them. </p><p>When they were first married my parents lived on East Fifth Street in Charlotte, in the upstairs of a house owned by my Dad’s Uncle Edward Yandle, and his sister, Lizzie Yandle. They were truly my Dad’s Aunt and Uncle, and Aunt Lizzie called my Dad’s mother “Sissie.” I’m confused a little about the kinship, because I have some information about my family, but am slightly confused about exactly where my Uncle Edward and his sister, Aunt Lizzie, fit into the family tree. </p><p>Sometime well before the Civil War (in the South it was called the “War Between the States”), a group of people came to the United States probably on the same ship who all seemed to be sort of kin to each other either by blood or by marriage. Some of them were married to each other in England, and some of them were married before they arrived in America, and some of them married each other after their arrival in the New World that would become the United States. In the crowd there were at least two very prominent names. One batch had the surname Johnston, and the other group had the surname of Yandle. Now the Johnstons had married the Yandles, and the Yandles had married the Johnstons. Since there were a few Johnstons who were not actually kin to each other, and a few Yandles also who, though they had the same name were not actually ken to each other, some of the Johnstons married Yandle girls, and Yandle men married Johnston girls, and once in a while a Johnston married a Johnston, and a Yandle married a Yandle, and trying to unravel all of those unions and was so confusing that I gave up, knowing that since my family must have been both Christian and educated, none of them would have married people that were too close kin to be safe where heredity was concerned. When they first arrived they didn’t all stay in the same town. Instead they scattered all over the nation, though a bunch of them stayed in the Carolinas. Some were in the Pineville, North Carolina area, which is only a few miles south of Charlotte, and a bunch of them crossed the Catawba River and lived near the little town of Mount Holly. At least one of them moved all the way to Philadelphia, and others scattered around the larger city of Charlotte, Pineville, Fort Mill, and Mount Holly.</p><p>If you were in or around Charlotte, or had kin folk in that area, you might remember that there was a train track across the Catawba from Charlotte to Mount Holly and points in between. It was not a long track leading everywhere, but a sort of commuter train. One of my Johnston Great Uncles was the engineer on that train that went back and forth between Mt. Holly and Charlotte several times each day. When I was four or five years old my kindergarten class rode on that train from Charlotte to Mt Holly, and back again. I was able to brag to my classmates that my very own Uncle Johnny was the engineer. However, I didn’t know him all that well, as he lived close to Mt. Holly. His real name was Serenas Johnston, and I think he was my Grandmother Yandle’s brother. He was the engineer on that train for an unusually long period of years, and when I was small we sometimes visited him on Sundays after Daddy bought a car. The steady riders of the train knew him by name, but they called him Johnny, not Serenas. My Dad said all of the regular riders seemed to be his personal friends. His sister lived in Mt. Holly too, only she had a different name as she had married name was Herms. Aunt Ollie always amused me when I was small because she was not very tall, and even though she bossed her tall boys and told them what to do, she herself was short, and her daughter was also not very tall, but both of them were quite bossy, and it was not wise to cross Aunt Ollie.<br/> When I was very small our family had no automobile, and therefore we didn’t visit people who lived very far away all that frequently. </p><p>a large group of kinfolks came to the United States from England. They didn’t all have the same last names, but most of them were either Johnston’s or Yandles. The Johnston’s often married the Yandles, and the Yandles often married the Johnstons. And somehow, there seemed to be at least two or more sets of both, and because they mostly came to America about the same time, they married each other. . —so that could marry Johnstons and not be too c and settled actually in a scattered pattern on both sides of the Catawba River. Some stayed in South Carolina, and some in North Carolina, and sometimes they switched around, but they all stayed when they were married. My Dad had an uncle and aunt who owned a house, and I think it was in the 500 block, not far from railroad tracks, My Dad had made the arrangements to move in there. I visited the house many times when I was a child, and I often wondered why my parents felt so close to those two old people who, so far as I, as a very small child, was concerned. I thought they were weird, and strange. First, they </p><p>He was working, I think, for Cathey Lumber Company which was owned by a man named John Cathey. He and his wife were wonderfully nice people, good Christians, and as fair and honest as people could be. </p><p>for the most part, people without jobs or families became a creature called a “hobo” and that meant that he lived by the railroad tracks, in some sort of makeshift sort of lean-to, or tent, or just under a tree close , but no kinfolk to take them in to shelter and feed them becameduevery likely without housing or food. Within a few days they discovered that businesses, great and small were having the same difficulties. Without the money they had banked they couldn’t pay wages. People in cities, in villages, and on farms faced the same problems. Money was scarce everywhere. Those who had no savings were affected also, because when banks closed, businesses that had banked their funds could not pay their workers. The workers in turn could not buy food, or pay </p><p>Renters without funds couldn’t continue to live in that house, and owner’s couldn’t afford to allow them to stayhad nthat they would lose every penny they had placed in a bank for s, and in many cases,panicked.

Businesses certainly not Their because their jobs stopped. salaries stopped being paid because companies were not being paid because peoplekarues ceased to be paid by failing businesses. Therefore, the company or individual who had agreed to allow them to pay so much each month, were not being paid, and had the right to take back their property. That meant people lost whatever they had paid so far on their purchase. Their homes, their automobiles, their plots of land for future building, their hopes and dreams and even the ability to buy groceries were now gone and they could never get their money back. They had made promises, and through no fault of their own they could not keep their promises. Their money, if it was less than the total amount, was simply gone. The businesses or owners to whom buyers had been paying simply said, sorry about that, and took back their houses, keeping what had been paid, leaving the people who had lost their jobs and were because of that unable to keep up the payments simply the agreement right then, nor, sadly was there ever</p><p>ever. the lack of jobs that supplied pay checks that were spent on the necessary housing and food suddenly stopped handing out pay checks because the businesses were not making enough money to meet the payroll. Banks which had gladly accepted deposits didn’t have enough money to return those deposits to their customers. There wasn’t enough money to go around. </p><p>y had no pay checks. their pay check, too. Some people couldn’t even buy groceries. the squelching dreams and was difficult for her to accept. She was sometimes required to help her mother take care of the little child by bringing items like diapers or milk bottles, or other necessities to a mother who was sitting down and holding—actually holding—that little baby. Mother had less time for Ella Cornelia becAttending to that little baby instead of doing things with little Ella Cornelia, and making little Ella Cornelia wait, or even help with the care of that surprise sister. How could she like the idea of having a baby in the house? Since we, ourselves, have two children, I can certainly understand the shock to small children who are suddenly aware that It nature e which was a hush, hush event, and which never, ever, was actually explained to children, which left them with really weird ideas about </p><p>. When she was born my parents were living with my Dad’s Aunt Lizzie, and I think her brother, Edward, lived there with her. Long before I was born there was a young girl who lived with them. She was the child of a cousin who was judged by the family as not capable of raising a child, and the girl whose name was never, ever, spoken in that house since she had become ill and died at the age of seventeen or eighteen, was dead</p><p>in a house on East Fifth Street with her brother, my Uncle Edward. Recently I had the opportunity of seeing facts about my “ancestors” and discovered that my paternal family was quite large. I think at least four families with the surname of Yandle, and they had lots of children, both male and female. There had been an earlier time when older Yandles had already come to the United States, and they were living much further north and west of the Carolinas, yet they were of the same family. A bunch of them settled in North and South Carolina. One of the men was my Great, Great Grandfather. He was a store keeper and lived somewhere near the town of Pineville, I think. </p><p>One of the first of the Yandles was named Samuel Yandle. He ran a store, and he arrived in the new world before the War Between the States (the Civil War). He was well settled in when the men of North Carolina and South Carolina who fought for the Confederacy went into battle. The Confederacy was poorly funded, of course, and when the Southern men formed armies and fought the soldiers from the North they left their wives and children behind on farms or in small towns, and as the months passed the women and children began to suffer from lack. With no one to plant and harvest except women, most of whom had small children, and very little money. My Great Grandfather ran a store where, among other goods, foods could be bought. That became a problem, too, because Confederate families had little money, and had not been able to plant and harvest since their men-folk were in the Confederate Army. Some of the women and children were, quite literally, starving. </p><p>Great Grandfather Yandle, was a merchant. He ran a store with various necessities for sale, including food. He was a good man, and he discovered that he just couldn’t turn away those women who came in to buy on credit the foods for which they couldn’t pay. When a skinny and hungry mother came in to buy food for her thin and hungry children, my Great Grandfather would reason—out loud. “Well,” he would begin, “I SAID that she needed food.” And therefore the lady got some food for her children. Of course, eventually, Great Grandfather was giving away what he had either paid for, or owed money for, and because he wasn’t paid for the food, he could not pay his suppliers. Because he couldn’t pay his suppliers his business sort of went downhill fairly quickly. However he fed those poor women and children as long as he could. </p><p>Eventually my Great Uncle Edward Yandle, who was a younger than my Grandfather, helped him to make settlements with the suppliers who had not been paid for the goods he gave away during the Civil War. All of that happened in the mid, or late 1860’s. I never knew that Great Grandfather, but I did know his son, Amos, who was my Dad’s father, and I also knew Great Uncle Edward and his sister, Elizabeth, who lived in Charlotte on East Fifth Street. here is no one alive now, who could tell me about really tell me , who was called Lizzie. </p><p>I was born in 1931, and by the time I was five or six years old Uncle Edward often visited the house we lived in on West Eleventh Street, and we visited the house where Uncle Edward lived with his sister, Lizzie. </p><p>I found it fascinating to learn that my Great Grandfather Yandle married twice. His first wife died, and he married again. His second wife lived to be a very old lady. She was married to my Great Grandfather for fifty years. and. His first wife died, and he remarried. A bunch of people including four brothers came to America </p><p>and before they came to the United States a good many years ago, and they were brothers and sisters and cousins. A least one Yandle woman married a Yandle man, and some of the boys had married girl </p><p>One of the largest changes I recognize in that part of our nation’s history which I have personally seen and recognized is the number of people in this country. I was born in 1931. Up until about five years ago I had lived all of my life in Charlotte, North Carolina. My Mother was born in Pineville, and my Dad in Mount Holly, just across the Catawba from Charlotte. When I was a child my Dad told me that Pineville was about ten miles from Charlotte; however, both Charlotte and Pineville have grown through the years, and I expect that they are a great deal closer to each other in this Year of our Lord 2006. </p><p>As a child I realized that there were several ways to move around the city. There were tracks right down the middle of the street where we lived that was named West Eleventh Street. The tracks were for the trolley cars which had funny little pipe things on top of them that touched electrical lines, and allowed the trolleys to move up or down the street, carrying people to the very center of Charlotte at a place called the Square. One night when I was probably close to five years old my mother took my sister and me on a trolley ride. She kept telling me to remember the ride, and never forget it. “This is the very last trolley ride along our street that there ever will be. Tonight,” she said, “the trolley cars will go to their garage, and they will never come back. From now on,” she explained, “we will ride buses instead of trolleys.” I did try hard to remember. And I know that, sure enough, there were no more trolley rides in Charlotte. Eventually the rails that had carried the trolleys and the wires that had given them electricity were removed. However, it was the very next morning that I began to recognize the city buses that passed our house at frequent intervals all day and way into the night.</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">   </span><span class="nv">I</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">don</span>’<span class="nv">t</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">know</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">any</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">part</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">of</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">West</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Eleventh</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Street</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">actually</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">exists</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">today</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">as</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">houses</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">and</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">businesses</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">along</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">that</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">street</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">were</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">removed</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">and</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">where</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">there</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">was</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">once</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">neighborhood</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">there</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">is</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">now</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ramp</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">leading</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">an</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">interstate</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">highway</span>.<span class="w">   </span><span class="nv">throughway</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">was</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">builtneighborhood</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">where</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">I</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">lived</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">before</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">I</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">married</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">was</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Grandparents had lived in a smaller town about ten miles away . That makes me about seventy-five years old in this year—2006. The house I have early memories of was not the first one my parents lived in when they came to Charlotte from Pineville area as newly weds, moving from their homes about . something like ten miles from the then center of Charlotte, I have no idea how many people were living in Charlotte, North Carolina when I was born. We lived eleven paved blocks from the Square, which was, by the time I was born merely the central intersection of two “main” streets, which were named Trade Street, which went East or West from that point, and Tryon Street, which went North or South from that point. The intersection there was one of the largest in the town. </p><p>About three blocks from the Square there was a street named “First Street” that ran east/west across South Tryon Street </p><p>probably two of the very first streets to be named. What I do know is that streets were laid out going in a fairly either East or West, nor North What I do know is that we lived about one mile from the Square in the City of Charlotte—the place where Tryon Street and Trade Street crossed each other. In the earliest days there was a building in the center of a space which served as a court house.</p><p>, That was also the point where the named streets abruptly changed where the first Courthouse was built, and that intersection was the focus point of the town. Some intelligent person way back at the time a small Courthouse was built on a hill, decided that the courthouse was the absolute center of Charlotte. There was eventually two roads that met near that Square, and one of them went from East to West from the Square, and was called simply Trade Street. The North-South road was eventually named for a Governor who’s last name was Tryon. ofrom the going North to South was eventually named for how it was used—where there were stores where business was done, and trades were made. It became Trade Street. The street that crofor a governor of North Carolinaa road that ran day when the city born decided that the spot on which a small building was standing that was called when it was first settled. Streets that stretched both east and west east and west . twenty minutes from the city limits if we it didn’t take much of a drive from our house almost any direction to find the city limits. It may be that driving North West from our house to the edge of town took a little longer than it took if we headed South and East from our house. if it was measured from our house, that a drive in a southeasterly direction. </p><p>was especially events that began after I could understand to some degree how very different things could become when can in our nation between my childhood and my old age is the population of this country, and the number of people in the world. Without doubt I can say there were fewer people in the world the year I was born than there are now, though it has been only seventy-five years. What has made a difference? Part of it is that When my Great Grandparents were young, there were situations fairly often like one my Dad’s told us about years ago.</p><p>I was quite young when my Dad told the story, however, the tale began with a man who married a wife, and they had twenty or more children. My Dad, of course named the man, but I was only about nine or ten years old at the time, and I am now seventy-five years old. I heard the story only once, on a winter evening. </p><p>My Dad’s uncle married a wife, and they had several children. However there were few remedies for illnesses in that day and time, and when his wife became ill, she died. She left a three or four very young children, at least one of them still nursing. The man knew he needed a mother for his children, and he also knew that a young woman who was recently widowed who needed someone to help her raise her children, and so they were married. Since she brought several children with her, and the farmer already and was nursing her own small child, so he married her, and she nursed both children. That young woman had other children; however one day she became ill, and she, too died, leaving a young child. The Uncle married again, and again the woman had a young child, and could nourish both her own child, and the baby whose Mother had just died. After some years, the farmer’s wife again died, and again he married fairly quickly as there was a tiny baby that had to be fed. His fourth wife also had a few older children, and she also had other children. ’s mther the two babies, children by her first husband, and again the Uncle and one day she, too, became ill, and died. No long after that she had another child had lost her husband, and she that needed to be bottle fed, and the </p><p>the mother of his children died. Because the man had to have someone to attend to those very young children, he married again, a young widow who had a child of her own that was quickly assimilated into the family. She of course had another child at least one child who was quickly assimilated into the family, and before long the step mother had </p><p>have forgotten the details it for no better reason than that I am now seventy-five years old, and the evening he mentioned his uncle I was only eight or ten years old. He mentioned that family only once that I remember, told us about his cousin (or an uncle, I forget which) who had about twenty-five children.</p><p>The why, from my point of view, is complicated because of the huge number of differences between way back then, and right now. I was born in 1931. The Great Depression began in 1929, and I’ve been told the crunch that was immediately felt in the North was not actually immediate in the South, but it didn’t take a lot of time to trickle right on down to Charlotte, North Carolina, where my parents lived most of their lives. My Dad was born in Mt. Holly, North Carolina, four years before the Twentieth Century began. My Mother was born in 1902 near Pineville, North Carolina. The parents of both my mother and my Dad were farmers. Both sets of Grandparents lived in the vicinity of Pineville by the time I was old enough to recognize where I was. My mother was a Parks before she was married. My Parks Grandparents lived not far from the area now dedicated to the birth place of President Polk. I never learned why it was necessary, but Granddaddy Parks built a new house at that location when my Mother was in her early teens, after his two sons and his older daughter had married and moved away. When I was in Grammar School if my Teachers asked me if I had any brothers and sisters I had to admit that I had a sister, however, I actually thought of us as both being “only” children. She didn’t like me and wished she had gotten her way the day I was introduced to her. She immediately suggested that since Mother had picked me up at Presbyterian Hospital, she should take me back to them, and leave me. She didn’t want a sister.</p><p>When my sister was nine or ten years old our family lived on East Fifth Street and there were lots of children her age in the neighborhood, and most of them were her friends. One day the Ella Cornelia joined a two team group of students who were playing jump rope. It was good exercise to have the students jumping about or turning the rope and using some of their marvelous energy out of doors. The game required a long and sturdy but not heavy rope, two members of the group with strong arms to turn the rope so that it touched the ground and arced over the jumpers to turn the rope, while all of the others would try to jump over the rope as it swished against the ground and up into the air over the heads of the jumpers, again and again. If a jumper touched the rope, or was touched by the rope, she was still part of the team, but she was for the moment, a spectator. The number of active jumpers diminished as the whirling rope touched them, especially as the jumpers tired. If only one jumper was left in the game, she could revive her team by jumping ten consecutive jumps meeting challenge . jumpers were touched by the ropekept on jumping, with the until each jumper touched, or was touched by, the they touched the rope, or the rope touched them, until there was only one jumper left. left her team of jumpers and became a spectator. was turned to touch the ground and then arc up into the air above the heads of the jumpers. If the turning rope touched a jumper she was out, and became a spectator. When only one jumper had not touched the rope she could, if her energy and skill was not diminished by her activity, jump ten consecutive turns of the rope without touching it. If she was able to do that, her team mates could rejoin her as if they had never been out of the game. The other team could not jump until the first batch of jumpers had all touched the turning rope and the last jumper left in the game failed to hop over the rope for ten times, which would restore her team as jumpers, instead of the the team changing places with th. </p><h2 id="and-were-therefore-without-anyone-to-keep-to-keep-the-game-going-my-sister-was-competitive-and-on-that-day-she-jumped-non-stop-in-ten-games-and-it-was-she-who-each-time-jumped-ten-times-alone-earning-the-right-for-all-of-her-team-to-rejoin-her-as-jumpers-two-girls-turned-the-rope-and-the-other-team-jumped-it-as-a-group-ella-cornelia-kept-jumping-her-team-mates-at-least-some-of-them-had-a-breather-when-they-had-to-leave-the-game-but-my-sister-didnt-have-a-breather-she-was-the-jumper-left-alone-each-time-and-she-then-jumped-ten-times-turns-of-the-rope-and-was-rejoined-by-her-team-mates-and-continued-to-jump-i-never-learned-exactly-what-time-of-year-it-was-or-if-the-weather-was-warm-or-hot-or-even-cold-what-i-do-know-is-that-very-quickly-after-that-she-became-ill-i-was-so-very-small-then-that-i-never-actually-knew-any-of-the-details-while-she-was-in-the-hospital-mother-stayed-with-her-as-much-as-possible">, and were, therefore, without anyone to keep to keep the game going. My sister was competitive, and on that day she jumped non-stop in ten games, and it was she who, each time, jumped ten times alone, earning the right for all of her team to rejoin her as jumpers. Two girls turned the rope, and the other team jumped it as a group. Ella Cornelia kept jumping. Her team mates, at least some of them, had a breather when they had to leave the game, but my sister didn’t have a breather. She was the jumper left alone each time, and she then jumped ten times turns of the rope, and was rejoined by her team mates, and continued to jump. I never learned exactly what time of year it was, or if the weather was warm, or hot, or even cold. What I do know is that very quickly after that she became ill. I was so very small then that I never actually knew any of the details. While she was in the hospital Mother stayed with her as much as possible.</h2><p>The parents of my Mother and my Father were still living. However, my Dad’s mother was an invalid, and her two daughters were taking care of her. My Father’s mother was an invalid, as she had several health problems, and was also blind. My Father was the only one of his siblings to marry at that time. My Mother’s parents were elderly and not very well, however my Mother’s sister was not much older than my Mother, and though she was married, she had no children. It was to my Mother’s sister, my Aunt Ola, that I was taken when my sister became ill</p><p>Both my parents had siblings, and in both families my grandparents were still living. My Dad’s mother was an invalid, and blind. His father was still working on his farm, along with his oldest son, my Uncle Eddie. was still hail and hearty, and was running his farm. His youngest sister was either in college, or was already working at a job in Charlotte, but Daddy had two sisters and one brother still at home. , and one brother.<br/> My Mother had two brothers, and one sister. My Dad had one brother, and three sisters. My Dad’s mother </p><p>when she pushed herself to jump ten games, and jumped ten turns of the rope between each game, without a rest. jumped that rope for so long, but I do know that the rope for ten games, and between each of themarm weather rather than was too young to remember what time of year nd each time her teammates touched the rope they had to leave the game, though they could stop jumping, but they cheered when young Ella, as the last jumper, jumped ten turns of the rope without touching it. Then they all, including Ella Cornelia who had no rest, began to jump again as a team. The group cheered Ella Cornelia, because they won. Their team had jumped ten games without loosing one. However soon after that triumph, Ella Cornelia became ill. Because I was very young—probably a little more than two years—I have not real memory of her being sick. When her condition became life threatening I was taken to my Mother’s sister for safe keeping until my sister was well again. I have very little memory of that time, but my Aunt Ola declared that I was not always happy. One day she, who had no children of her own, washed my hair, and I have a very faint memory of being in her arms and crying. </p><p>waited to see if the last teammate left jumping could jump the rope ten times, which would allow the entire team to rejoin their teammate and give their team another one of their team mates could j</p><p>their turn at jumping was over. and left the game one at the time, she was the one who jumped ten times alone in order bring her team back into the game. I was too small to remember her triumph, but that evening my sister became very ill. Of course she was taken to a physician. He was Doctor John Ashe, of Charlotte, N.C. My sister was very ill. Pleurisy attacked her lungs, and her heart was irregular. </p><p>My Mother believed that it was the jump rope game that triggered illness, making her breathless and straining her heart with her earnest efforts to jump every game until she was the last jumper, and then jumping ten turns of the rope so that her team could start all over again for ten consecutive games. </p><p>The year was probably 1932 or 33. I was a little young at the time, barely learning to talk, and remember nothing about the exact year, however, my guess is very close to the truth. I had no part in the events just then, except that I was taken to visit my Aunt Ola, who had no children, and hadn’t been around many children since she looked after her younger brothers and sister, all of whom were now married. I, myself, remember nothing of that period, except that she washed my hair. </p><p>Unfortunately there were few medicines that actually worked. Infections either went away, or they didn’t. People desperately ill either got well, or they died. The Medical profession was busy and in many situations they were wonderfully capable of saving lives; however, no there the medications we enjoy today had not yet been discovered. Sulfa was being used, and surgery was making a true difference in saving lives, but for the problems my sister was having there was very little anyone could do. may have been one antibiotic, if Sulfa could be counted as one, but thereIf the infection was life threatening, there were not many options. Rest, nursing care, and occasionally surgery, were the available treatments of nearly all the illnesses. If the heart had been strained and was not pumping correctly, and if lungs were not functioning exactly as normal, there was very little to do except pray, and hope for the best. It was not, money wise, the best of times to be expensively sick. My Dad was working at a Lumber Yard, but they had no business. Almost everyone in the entire country was in the same predicament. Banks closed so that people who had savings accounts wouldn’t empty them causing the bank to fail. Businesses were closing because they had no customers, and they couldn’t pay their employees if they didn’t have customers. </p><p>Life was tough everywhere. </p><p>If you noticed the date—the early 1930’s—you know this was smack in the middle of the time the Depression was causing difficulties in every part of the nation. Jobs disappeared when most of the population stopped buying much of anything. Any savings people had trusted to banks were mostly wiped out. Stores closed for lack of patrons. Businesses could not continue because there was so little trade of any kind. Employees had no salaries when their business closed. Stores that had managed to stay open had few paying customers. Most businesses were not bringing in enough funds to provide salaries for the employees and many stores simply closed because they couldn’t pay their rent nor keep their shelves stocked, or if they had something to sell there were no customers who had money enough to buy. No employer was hiring. People who rented dwellings, whether it was a house or just a room, could not always scrape up enough money to pay their rent, and were sometimes ordered to leave the premises and some times were not allowed to take their belongings with them. Housing on which monthly payments were owed could seldom continue the payments, causing them to lose not only everything in which they had already invested, but even the roof over their heads. </p><p>It was a sad time. Almost everyone was in the same sort of difficulty. People who had food often shared with those who had no food. Families who had shelter took in family members who did not. People who had gone to cities to “make their fortune” and now couldn’t even pay their rent simply went back home if they could, sometimes walking hundreds of miles to get there. At our house cousins who were looking for jobs in Charlotte would “stay” with us for weeks or months until they were settled in real jobs and could afford to live in an apartment.<br/> My family and I lived within a block, or maybe two blocks, of at least two different railroads. Many times a knock at our back door—not the front door—would be a shabby looking man who would ask if I could give him food. Mother would always make them a sandwich, usually with cheese because we didn’t have much meat, and hand that and a cup of coffee, or a glass of milk, and the man would sit on the back steps and eat the food, then leave the plate and glass on the steps. None were ever threatening, nor were they angry if we were at that moment unable to accommodate them. We didn’t see women doing the same thing. And most of the men were middle aged or elderly. </p><p>Once an older lady lived next door to me, and I found her vocabulary, and the way she pronounced words unique. She could read, and she was not at all dumb about business, or caring for the house she occupied. However she had never seen a television until recently, nor lived in a city, or even on a well-traveled road. Her schooling was sparse, and her entire life had been busy with few moments of relaxation. Her name was Mae, and she sat on her front porch along a very busy Charlotte street. Early my relationship with her she would look at me in true wonder at the traffic that passed our neighboring houses, “It does look like they’d all get where their going sometime.”<br/> She would sit on her porch and marvel at the traffic, and say in bewilderment as the cars passed in unending late afternoon streams of cars, “It does look like they would all get to where they are going sometime.”</p><p>had she listened to radio. She had read mostly the Bible, having very little access to books. or without </p><p>Most people had no salaries, any savings entrusted to a bank was gone, and there were no new jobs available. had lost any savings, and many banks had failed so that funds Jobs gone, homes gone, and little or no hope of retrieving jobs or investments. The and therefore lost everything they had already invested, which was another blow. Jobs were disappearing. No one was building new housing nor were folks choosing to renovate during those years. Stores of all sorts had no customers. People were actually going hungry. It was quite reminiscent of that period after the release of the </p><p>My Dad’s job was with a lumber yard. There were no customers as no one was building at the time, since very few, if any, ordinary persons could buy much of anything. If a builder had actually begun to build, he probably had simply stopped. No one was buying houses, nor were people spending on anything they could postpone. , and those who had not yet completed a building , and therefore quite soon there was no job. My Dad, along with his father, had invested in, but not completely paid for, several houses. Some of them were located in an area where only Negro families lived. They were fairly sturdy buildings, but they had neither electricity nor running water. Water was available and could be drawn from a central pump, and it was not terrible not to have electricity. Actually neither my Mother’s nor my Father’s parents had access to electricity or piped in water with indoor toilets. Their water came in from a Spring or a Well, and their toilets were out houses not far from their back doors. </p><p>If the sickness would not disappear after surgery, there was very little anyone could do apart form rest and problem area could be surgically removed, things usually went very well. However about the only hope for illness that surgery would not help was those that responded to good food, and careful rest. if the illness would respond to bed rest, diligent attention to rest and good food. usually only two options: If it was something that surgery could remove, the patient had a good chance of overcoming the illness. If it was not operable, but the patient was really otherwise healthy, and time could thereby heal the problem, the patient would only good nursing and strong healthy folk would surviveAt the time, there were no actual antibiotics that worked every time. </p><p>doctor, Dr. John Ashe, My sister was good at jumping rope. She, therefore, was the only one still jumping when the other jumpers during the first game, and she jumped ten perfect jumps therefore allowing her team returned to jump with her through the next game. </p><p>erson was left who, that jumper left the gameA touch meant that jumper was “out” of the game. When a group is jumping it doesn’t take long to thin out the less athletic jumpers, or the jumpers who tire easily, or those who loose their concentration on the game as they tire. team” of jumpers rope itself was fairly long, accommodating a group of jumpers which would diminish as jumpers touched the rope and therefore were out of the game. When only one jumper all were . As each jumper tired or misjudged the rhythm of the rope she would touch the rope and therefore be “out” of the game. When only one jumper of that team was left she was given a “chance” to successfully jump the rope ten times, which accomplishment would allow her entire team to return to jumping, instead of taking up the duty of turning the rope. </p><p>My sister was agile and always eager to excel. When she was the last one of the team jumping the long rope, she jumped ten jumps without touching the rope, and thus won the right for her team to return to jumping—not turning—the jump rope. Of course it was a tiring game. However my sister ignored tiredness. She jumped ten games, and each time her team faltered and her teammates were sent to the side</p><p>she loved to win, therefore each time all her team mates were “out” of the game, she managed to jump ten turns of the rope, therefore winning the privilege of having her team return to the jumping game instead of taking up the responsibility of turning the rope for the other team. her team of jumpers to return to jumping, instead of left the gameclassmates </p><p>their taking their turn of , if she could jump ten turns of the rope without touching the rope, the entire team was “in” again. My sister was in the group that was jumping. She jumped with the group and was the last one who had not touched the rope, and summoned the energy to jump ten good jumps, thereby allowing her team to rejoin her. Her team was still jumping instead of turning the rope. Jump Rope was both energetic and fun, and since it was a school game, bunches of students could jump at the same time when the rope was long enough to accommodate them. Usually there were two teams. One team would turn the rope, and the other would be the jumpers. When all members of the jumping team had touched the ropeThe rules demanded that when only one jumper remained students turned the rope. The others stood in a line, and as the rope touched the ground, the entire group jumped over it. When a jumper touched the rope, she was out of the game; however, the rest of the group could jump until only one jumper was left. If that jumper touched the rope, the team changed, with the former jumpers was still jumping. Eventually it was expected that the jumping team would touch the rope, and then that team would begin to turn the rope, and the other team could jump the all of the jumpers on that team would eventually touch the rope, and the group that was turning the rope would have hand the rope to tha turn to jump. another group would become the jumpers, and those who had served as jum and the other team would be the jumpers, and two of the of jumpers and had to stand aside while her teammates kept jumping. When only one jumper had not touched the rope, that lucky little girl could jump ten turns of the rope without touching it, and her team could rejoin her, until everyone who was jumping was “out”. was left </p><p>, and as the rope slapped the ground anyone who touched the rope, or whom the rope touched, had to stand aside, leaving only those jumpers who had successfully managed not to let the rope touch them. Usually the jumpers were a mixed group, some being athletic and competitive, some wanting to touch the rope so they could leave the game and stand around talking to their friends and the others who worked hard to win for their team. My sister was a jumper, determined that her group would win because she didn’t like turning the rope. She was skillful, and when everyone except herself had touched the rope it was up to my sister to jump alone for ten turns of the rope without touching it, and her team was “in” again, having “won” the privilege because one of their number jumped ten times without touching the rope. of jumping instead of since they could jump, causing the other team to stand just turning the rope, , instead of turning the rope for the other group. Ella Cornelia was good at jump rope. She willingly ignored tiredness to win another chance for her team. And so for ten games her team members disappeared one at the ti</p><p>she did. When all the jumpers except my sister had touched the rope and left the game, my sister concentrated on her task which was to jump the rope without touching it ten times—then her team could reenter the game, and her team would therefore win the game. </p><p>was a good thing my Mother and Daddy loved me, or I might have been one miserable little girl. Ella Cornelia did not seriously threaten harm to me when I was very small, however, when I started to school Mother went to work at a sewing shop with </p><p>, and upon occasion that left the two of us together for an entire afternoon. </p><p>That if I was told why it was necessary, I don’t remember the answer. Granddaddy Parks was a strong man, a farmer, a father of four children, and a grandfather of five, one boy, and four girls. My Grandmother was white haired, and I thought she was beautiful. Her complexion was very fair, and her hair was white as snow and pulled into a knot . </p><p>a teenager, They had once lived in another place, which I never saw. They built their house in the new location when my mother was quite young. She had one sister, and two brothers, all of whom were already married, so that she was the only child of her parents still living at home. She told me about a time that once something slipped, causing the weight of the house to descend on her father’s hand. The weight of the house was mashing his hand, and he could not move it. My mother stood beneath a place that she could reach, and she pushed with her shoulder, and stood straight, holding the floor high enough for her father to remove his bruised hand. From that time on, she often had back pain when she lifted heavy items. Mother, who’s name was Minnie Cole Parks Yandle, married my father, Leroy Samuel Yandle, when she was about eighteen. My Dad was in his twenties. I don’t really know much about the early years of my Parent’s married life, because I was wasn’t born until my sister was about seven years old. I do know that when my parents were first married they lived with my Dad’s Aunt and Uncle. </p><p>I have always been puzzled about those two people, my Great Aunt and Uncle, mostly because I never really understood their exact relationship to me. They were elderly, and I was very young when I knew them. Uncle Edward was never called anything else except “Uncle Edward” in my presence, and his sister was always “Aunt Lizzie.” Since I remember the story, I must surmise that I was about eight or nine years old, myself, because I never actually heard the story again. </p><p>Mother had washed some clothes and needed to hang them on the clothes line in the back yard. Mother had brought her little baby downstairs and had placed her in a highchair inside the screened in porch which was also latticed. Mother hurried into the back yard and began to hang up the clothes. She felt somewhat relieved that her little darling Ella Cornelia was happily cooing and chuckling all by herself. Mother hurried to finish her chore, pleased that her little darling was gurgling and laughing as if she were being happily entertained. When Mother entered the porch, though, she was surprised, but not pleasantly. My tiny sister’s high chair had been set, unfortunately, just in arms reach of Aunt Lizzie’s large green fern, and my little sister had easily entertained herself, with chuckles and squeals, as she reached out and pulled all the leaves off the fronds of half of the beautiful fern, and then watched them fall as if they were green snow flakes sifting onto the floor, as she laughed her happy little laugh.

Mother had washed diapers and baby clothes and she carried my sister and the wet laundry down to a back porch, which was screened in. She left my sister carefully tied into the high chair, inside the latticed back porch, and went outside to hang out the clothes. She listened carefully to the sounds her little baby was making, and they were joyful sounds. She was laughing. Mother hurried to finish hanging out the clothes and started up the steps. It seems that the high chair my sister was sitting in was just close enough to touch the greenery in a hanging basket.

I didn’t learn until years later that Mother and Daddy had lived in their house when he and Mother were first married, and that they were living there when my sister was born, and for some time afterwards. I know that only because one day my Mother was talking to some visitor, and told the visitor about a funny thing my sister did when she was a baby. It seems that Mother was hanging out clothes in the back yard of Aunt Lizzie’s house. The young Yandle family was living on a clotheslineone and told them</p><p>He was my Dad’s uncle. Ordinarily that would mean he was my Grandfather Yandle’s brother. However, they were nothing alike, and Uncle Edward and Aunt Lizzie were older than my Grandfather. They also had an entirely different accent, and their habits and their house, and Uncle Edward’s business seemed very strange to me. , mostly because my parents knew very well who they were, respected them both greatly, and treated them like revered elders in our family. , and I think they were step sister and step brother to my Grandfather. However, I could be mistaken as no one every told me why their conversation was so different from the way we all talked, being dyed in the wool Southerners. Uncle Edward, and his sister, Aunt Lizzie, were very proper. Aunt Lizzie always wore an apron over her dress, and she never, ever, touched a door knob with her bare hands. She lifted her apron and placed it on the door knob and then turned it to open the door. I never saw her without an apron unless she was going to church or to visit someone. They had a very different vocabulary than most of the people I knew, and they truly didn’t speak as if they were Southerners. They were also quite old by the time I made their acquaintance, and I have to admit that their way of life sort of fascinated me, and yet I thought they both were more than a little strange. </p><p>They both were well educated, Both of them were well educated, and did not converse exactly like the other aunts and uncles in the family. I know that my Grandfather Yandle’s mother died when he was quite young, and that he was raised by his father’s second wife, who was born in England. Apparently Great-Grandfather’s second wife had been married previously, and at first my parents and later my Ella Cornelia, too, lived on East Fifth Street in Charlotte in a house owned by my Dad’s Uncle Edward and his sister, Aunt Lizzie. Her real name was Elizabeth, but she was called Lizzie. Their house no longer exists, as it was torn down to build some large building when I was in my early teens. Although I lived not far from that location most of my life, I never wanted to see the building that had replaced most of the houses along that side of the street. mthe my Day’s early life as I wasn’t yet My Dad worked in a lumber yard, owned by a man named -----------. He and his wife were members of Garr Auditorium, a church . From what I was told much later, the lumber yard was doing a brisk business. My Dad had bought two houses, and he had rented them to people who paid every month. He used the rent money to make payments on the houses, and he used his salary to live on. He, and his father, had joined together to buy six rental houses in a section of town where only Negro people lived. It had been nearly fifty years since slaves were freed; however, in the South, former slaves two houses, . He was young, married, and had a daughter about three or four years old, . the entire nation was affected by the consequences. My Dad worked in a lumber yard. Of course people were not building homes. Without doubt there has been a tremendous, almost unbelievable increase in the number of people in the United States since then. This rise cannot be totally attributed to immigrants, though there have been many of them. Nor can it be because people desire to leave one country and move to another, although a great many people have come from other nations. Of course, since there has been no actual world wide war fought within the boundaries of our country except the time that Britain tried to force the colonies from claiming their freedom from all other nations. 88888888of Europekeep the United States as its Then why are there so many people in this country? Part of the increase in numbers within our nation has been because people left the countries where they were born and moved here. And that surely is part of the reason our nation has so many residents. However that logically would not change the total number of people, even if the “new” locations were cleaner due to never before having been occupied by crowds of people. Even so, people thrived in what some called the New World. there) simply moving from one place to another were simply better is not the only reason that there are more people in the world now than ever there was before, so far as we can know. </p><p>The number of people in the United States didn’t grow to what it is today because the first settlers were simply prolific in producing children. What actually happened was that when Great Britain claimed the East Coast, Spain and France wanted a share, and began sending shiploads of people to settle the land. The Spanish settled south of the English settlers, and the French settled north of the English folk. China even placed lot of people on the Western Coast, and San Francisco still has a very active Chinese population. The people who came from England were the first that we know of who actually made an effort to make a colony on this continent. However, some of the countries in the Northern part of Europe had ocean going crafts early in the history of tribes and groups of people, and they knew about the northern part of what is now Canada and the United States before any other people discovered it. </p><p>There was no doubt that Europe, England, Ireland, France, Spain, and other countries, such as Greece, Italy, and Northern Africa, and certainly, don’t leave out China. All were looking for riches and expansion. Have not all people done that all though history? When ordinary people invented ways to keep a ship or boat on top of the oceans, explorations were made. Explorations led to change. And people who had riches by what ever standard, usually wanted more, and were willing to explore. Then there were people who had nothing but a willingness to work hard because they wanted their lives to be better than they were, and they had no fear of work. There were always problems of some sort where there were lots of people. There was seldom a dearth of willing adventurers who dared to go into places they had never been before. People such as Columbus who took a real leap into history and discovered the edge of half of the earth that the other half had never known existed. </p><p>Then Spain, and France, England, and probably some of the Northern most folk tried, and actually crossed the Atlantic. If they kept going, they found either the North, Central, or South America. </p><p>the American first, and France claimed the South where New Orleans is located, while other French folk went far into the North, in what was later Eastern Canada. Many of the decedents of those folk still speak French, rather than English. The population of the country of the United States began on the East Coast and the earliest folk were English, and those who came a little later were from all nations around the Mediterranean. The British Islands were prominent, including the Irish and the Scottish people. Spain claimed the Florida area. this country was smaller, and it was not growing with super speed, despite the fact that as the country was already expanding more. From all over the then known world more people were coming to a brand new country—a wonderful place that was advertised as a paradise, when it actually took a great deal of hard work to survive in its earliest days. From the beginning of the nineteenth century life here was improving, but it was never without either some danger, as well as a great deal of hard work. Many folk in Spain, France, Italy, Greece, England, Ireland, Northern Africa, and other parts of the world could imagine a better world away from worn out farming land, and ngland, Europe, and all of the known world hoping to find a better, easier, place to live. </p><p>and Europe and other parts of the world . Birthing children, especially if there was only about a year between the children, was very hard on the mother. little space between the children, . Cities and towns were smaller. When my grandparents were young, they were sad when infant children died, and they realized that the price of pregnancy could easily be—and too often actually was—the death of the mother. When women died trying to give birth to a child, and the child survived, the father of that little baby had to find a woman already nursing her own child—or a woman whose recently born child had not lived, or a neighbor woman who could nurse the infant. In those days it was not impossible to raise a child on cow or goat milk, but that , or all the people in a family got sick and died because there was no antidote for their illness. Surgery was terribly chancy. Women were particularly almost always at extreme risk when birthing their children—and if a woman had as many as three children it was almost a miracle if all three lived. However, by the time I was born, there were hospitals available, with hopefully clean and sterile instruments and knowledgeable doctors. However well meaning, not all doctors were as careful as they should have been in trying to help desperately sick patients. Probably about twenty years before my birth my Aunt Helen became ill. Her physician, feeling a tremendous need to help his patient overcome whatever disease she had, gave her a potion that, whether or not it helped overcome the disease, rotted all her teeth, and she was only twenty years old. For the rest of her life Aunt Helen wore false teeth. </p><p>Then, as now, Doctors sometimes made bad choices in treatments, when medical training and knowledge was new when someone was dying, a doctor, if he was bold and brave, would simply try something. The patient was already dying. If the medicine helped it would be wonderful. If it didn’t help, at least he tried, and it wasn’t really wrong because the patient was already dying before he ordered the medication. It was certain that doing nothing accomplished nothing. The patient would die anyway. Therefore, why not try? If the patient got better, the doctor would be the hero. If the patient died, he was dying anyway. </p><p>I have often wondered how physicians react inside their minds and hearts when they work as hard as possible to save a patient, and then loose the battle. In the early days of medicine most doctors, no matter how dedicated, had few thought often of how awful it would be for a physician to treat folks, and watch them die because he didn’t have any medicines nor did he have information that could help. How wonderful is our medical community now, with both medications and well tried protocols to follow when terrible illnesses occur. </p><p>from some concoction and the patient was near death, why not at least take a try at helping when doing nothing meant certain death. Families would beg for help where none was available, so that physicians would try untested experiments in treatments, causing damage to some part of the body. People often died of illnesses in those days—and women were particularly vulnerable because of childbirth. Then there were deaths frequently from diseases that no longer exist. Smallpox spread easily, and once it began it could, and did, devastate communities and towns. In Europe there had been many terrible situations where illness struck a country, a city, a town, a village, or just a family, and all died. Although I haven’t tried to see my vaccination scar in years, before I could enter school I had to have an inoculation to prevent my ever having small pox—a disease that could and did sweep over Europe and which occurred in America, as well. The inoculation would cause my body to make antibodies to the disease, and it would make a scar on my shoulder that would always prove that I had been inoculated and could not then catch the disease, nor could I spread it to others. Small Pox was so terribly contagious, and so terribly deadly to its victims, that in the United States, because of the inoculation requirement in schools, eventually wiped it out completely. After many years the only place you could find Small pox was in some freezer where a “bank” might have been kept by a scientist who worked to extremely contagious. People in a city ran away into some other place from that illness. Towns emptied of everyone who could move or be moved when Small pox was rampant; therefore spreading the deadly disease further and further from its origin. Whole families, or many members of a family, died quickly. Terrified neighbors would try to run away from the danger, oftentimes carrying the illness itself with them so that the area of danger grew ever larger in an attempt to run away from it. Small Pox was a killer. Another terrible illness was Infantile Paralysis which caused muscles, any or all of them, to stop functioning, leaving its victims totally, or sometimes partly, unable to feed or care for themselves. f a person to breathe. The body’s muscles didn’t work. Legs would walk, arms and hands did not hold things, and sometimes even lungs were affected so that the person could not breathe. Those folk would—with their minds still working, they lay like a long, unable to attend to themselves at all, with a machine breathing for them,Most of the inhabitants of entire towns and villages could die from Small Pox because its germs were both powerful and so easily spread. is no more, but once it devastated cities and towns, causing death and spreading from person to person. Children no longer have to be vaccinated for it before they enter school. Chicken pox has disappeared, as had measles. There has not been a case of infantile paralysis since my children were in grammar school. whether or not it helped that patient fight his/her illness. </p><p>both our Nation, our States, and our Cities had become sensitive to the spread of communicable illnesses. There were several kinds of such diseases. Some, like Chicken Pox, Mumps, and the three or four types of Measles were common especially among children. The Health Department in Charlotte demanded that these sicknesses be reported, and that the sick person stay in his own house. A man from the Health Department came to the house and posted a warning sign to all who came to the door that someone in that house was suffering from a communicable disease. The purpose was to stop the spread of contagious diseases, therefore reducing the possibilities of wide spread illnesses. Some of the plagues were serious, and all of them were uncomfortable. The sign could come down after a certain number of days. On that day, my mother lifted me off the floor, and let me yank it down. I was very glad that once the sign was gone, I could play outside again.</p><p>So far as I remember, the only illness that required its victims to be completely separated from the population was tuberculosis. That was a fatal, debilitating, and highly contagious lung disease. There were no remedies. The only treatment was rest, sunshine, and clean air. It was so contagious that every person who contracted was taken to a hospital from which he was released only if by death, or cure. Since there was no medication, most of the people who entered the TB hospital died there. Occasionally, but depressingly seldom, a person’s own body could defeat the illness, and he or she could return to normal life. a patient’s own bodily fought the disease hthe disease was reported </p><p>Of course I was sheltered from the diseases that were rampant among some of the people who lived in our city. Charlotte, after all, was one of the largest towns in the state, and had railroads and highways. At school the playground was shaped mostly like an L. The front of the school faced a thoroughfare. There was a very narrow grassy yard leading to the front door. The brick walls of the school were close the street and close to empty red dirt tprotected from the streets students were protected from a neighborhood behind the schooI can still remember the day I walked away from my playmates on the playground of my school and decided to see what was behind the strong fence along Smith Street. I was probably about ten years old at the time, and what I saw was more than simply frightening. There was a man walking toward my spot behind the fence, and there was something strange about him. He wore ordinary clothing, and a hat. But his face was not normal. There was a bloody sort of mess above his mouth, and his nose was disintegrating—it was almost not there at all. He said something to me, something like, “What are you looking at?” and I didn’t answer him. I couldn’t. I couldn’t turn away, nor could I walk away. The shock of such a face made my stomach feel weird. That night I told my mother about it. She admonished me for wandering off alone from everyone else on the schoolyard, and suggested that I stay with the other students, with a group. Then she told me that there was a dirty kind of illness people could get, and the germs ate their noses. They were not only bad people, they were sort of stupid, too. The name of the disease was syphilis, and he caught it by being dirty and doing wrong things. </p><p>the distant edge of the playground that touched the sidewalk of Smith Street. There were houses along it, and I had never noticed it before, and lots of other illnesses that are rarely seen in this country in this day and time, but when I was a child, they happened. There were health rules in the City of Charlotte, especially where communicable diseases were involved. People who were ill were some imes compelled to report the fact to the Health Department of their city or town. If the disease was Tuberculosis, or some other highly communicable and deadly disease, or even something like chicken pox or measles, it had to be reported to the Health Department so that warning signs could prevent people from going to the door risking becoming contagious themselves. </p><p>When I had measles, and also when I had Chicken Pox, the Health Department of the City of Charlotte came to our house and nailed a poster beside our door warning people that a Person in our house was ill with a communicable disease. As the sick child I could not go out of my house at all. I still remember that when I was in the third grade the City of Charlotte shortened the school year because when the days became warm there was an outbreak of a disease called Infantile Paralysis some miles from Charlotte, but great portions of our State did not allow children to play with neighbors, or to go to movies, or to visit neighbors. I couldn’t even go to the library. This was long before television was introduced, and the City of Charlotte had a program every day for children who had to stay inside their houses that summer in order to stay away from other children. That was an illness that killed, and that crippled people. It was also called Poliomyelitis. This was the same illness that, though he was an adult, Franklin D. Roosevelt contracted before his election to Presidency of the United States. After that illness President Roosevelt used a wheel chair. It wasn’t only poor folk who contracted these communicable diseases. Sometimes sources of water from streams or creeks or even rivers would carry germs that caused outbreaks of illnesses. </p><p>In the homes in Pineville and the outskirts of Charlotte where city water was not available people used wells and springs. In most instances the water was safe to drink—but occasionally chemicals or contaminated water would seep through into a spring or well, and whole families would become ill or even die of the illness. </p><p>Medical doctors were not always well trained, though most practitioners used </p><p>as well, a quarantine sign was placed on our door so that people who had not already had the diseases would stay away in order not to carry the illness to persons who could be infected. there was a poster about the size of a sheet of notebook paper that with the prominent name of the illness </p><p>city or community and there was nothing toavailable. There were few effective medicines before 1940. Sulfa was about the only antibiotic there was, and it was limited because it didn’t work in all circumstances. Doctors knew how to sew up cuts, but they couldn’t keep the cuts from festering and causing rather terrible illnesses and death. orm becoming wasn’t effective for every illness—just some of them. There were doctors, and universities dedicated to medicine.ecine a from the </p><p>world in which we are living. present, or how previous situations similar to the events they are facing were handled so that they themselves might avoid repeating difficulties. </p><p>It is true that my life has been much easier than my mother’s life. Her life was easier than that of her mother. Today’s differences were wonderfully obvious and effective. Of course, people react to circumstances differently and events that are a catastrophe to some folk are a mere slight hitch to others. There are always people who want things to be different. However, it is always true that education and dedication along with clarity of thought, makes a good life for most people. using make the best of education is still important. Attending movie shows and viewing TV had never been the height of ambition. North Carolina had schools. There were City Schools, and then there were Country Schools. Within the cities children could usually walk to school. In the countryside, schools had different rules—at least in North Carolina they did. In cities and large towns schools were usually within walking distance of its pupils. In the Counties of North Carolina schools were also built near housing, however, in the countryside the homes of the pupils were usually too far distant from the schools for the children to walk, and therefore a bus system was put in place with routes covering the area, enabling drivers to bus children to and from school each school day. It has been a very long time since the counties around Charlotte had to arrange their school year to accommodate the children of farmers. It was often necessary for children to help prepare the fields and plant the crops. They also had to hoe weeds out of the fields to keep the weeds from stealing nourishments and water from the crops. Having vegetable gardens is wonderful, but requires lots of work. Preparing the field, sewing the seed, cleaning out weeds, and then doing it all over again until harvest time, and then the work changes to harvesting the fruits, vegetables, or grains of plants, and preserving them to eat or use later. With foods, vegetables must be canned, frozen, or dried to preserve them. The grains must be collected, and the grains themselves separated form the stalks they grew on. Most farmers like to use all parts of a harvest so that the stems of some plants provide hay or straw, and the vegetables and grains provide food and bread for people, and animals. Food animals like beef cattle, pigs, chickens, are unusually kept and fattened until after frost, , . of the plants. roduction of the plants, is as the same Mother Nature who nourishes the vegetables and grains also nourishes the wild grass and weeds. The from planting </p><p>and out of the vegetable gardens to keep weeds, which seem to grown much faster and than from out weeds. and so that who were expected to work in the fields of their father’s farms at planting time, and at harvest time. Therefore, the school year for city schools differed from that of country children because most farm children had to begin school after Harvest time, and they had to be available for field work when it was planting time. The school year began in the fall, after harvest, and was in session until Spring, when children had to help plant and work the fields. Autumn after post-pone school until the crops were planted, or later in the year, until the crops were harvested. When I was school age the county schools still arranged their calendars to fit the planting and harvesting of crops, closing the entire school at harvest time. Farming was not easy because it was governed by the time of the year and the weather. There was planting time, and harvest time, and in between there was watching the crop and chopping weeds that wanted to grow in the fields, and there was protection of the crops from bugs and birds, and too much heat with no rain when the fields were watered by barrels carried along by wagons. During that time the rhythm of the farm did not stop where animals were concerned. Animals such as oxen and horses and mules were busy and worked very hard. Because they were not machines, but creatures, it was necessary that they have rest, feed, water, and shelter during inclement weather. The lack of an able animal could ruin crops, just as completely as lack of sunny days or in due course, lack of rain. In those days the farmer walked behind the mule or horse, enduring the summer heat just like the animals. And most of the time if there was a trip to make to into a town, then the farmer had either to walk himself, or to force his already tired horse or mule to carry him—no matter how heavy he was—into town. </p><p>In North Carolina there were public schools with knowledgeable teachers in cities and in counties. There were also laws that demanded that children attend school. One of the reasons was that sometimes parents of long ago believed that children belonged so thoroughly to the parents that parents could make their children stay at home to work in the house, in a family business, or on a farm instead of going to school to learn how to read and write. That is one difference between the time my parents were growing up, and the years when I was old enough to attend school. Neither my mother nor my father actually finished twelve grades of school. That did not stop their learning and/or progressing. And their experiences made finishing all of the schooling we could get a priority for my sister and for me. </p><p>Children of today may have been told that there was a law that prevented the Mommy and Daddy persons from allowing their little child to skip school because he didn’t like it. It was, instead, a punishable offense if parents did not place their children in school. </p><p>More people were literate and more were better educated than their forebears. There were more doctors who were trained in better ways, and our nation as a whole was creating and accepting new inventions that made life easier. Cotton Mills were built to make thread and fabrics and factories were built to make cotton thread into cloth and when machines were being invented to increase the ease of transportation there were more jobs than workers. Then there were the new methods of communication such as the telegraph and telephone. Manufacturing grew as inventers worked to invent machines to do a tremendous variety of difficult and time consuming jobs. Communication became easier with dependable mail deliveries, and , and access to electricity was spread over the country.</p><p>, and the growth of manufacturing, specifically the cotton mills, the marvel of electricity for power, the continuing methods of transportation, the birth of the automobile and better methods of paving roads. There was also both State and National interest in roads, and most particularly the extension of train tracks. The by train, and out of manufacturing, as well. There was also the marvel of electricity and the welcome ease of communication because of railroad traffic and the invention of the telegraph and the telephone. </p><p>I, myself, was witness to changes that made our city, our county, our state, and our nation a world leader in many areas of importance. I was also a child who was born when our nation was in one of its worst possible positions. I was born in 1931. You may as what I mean about worst positions in the early 1930’s. The fact is that the stock market crash triggered the Depression. And because the heart of the northern states was trade—the buying and selling—the heart of the southern states was agriculture. It took a little longer for the lack of funds to affect the agricultural South. However when cotton mills stopped working because no one in the northern part of the country was buying their product, the mills closed. Without wages and moneythere was no buying, and therefore people with crops of cotton to sell had no buyers, and that made it difficult for folks in the South who couldn’t sell cotton, commerce, andThe Southern farmers couldn’t buy anything from the Northern States because the rest of the Northern country couldn’t buy their products of the ------ was not simultaneous with the fall of the stock market. It followed the crash of the stock market. Now most folks today remember that the Great Depression occurred in 1929. In the Southern part of the country below the Mason Dixon Line the immediate results didn’t hit quite so early. The economy in the South was based on cotton and tobacco, and to some extent also grains and food products. In the North the </p><p>telegraphwas improving the lack of roads, and supporting better communication. Rules and laws of decency were enforced, especially in the older communities near the East Coast. Nothing was, or is, perfect. The fact that our country had allowed slavery was difficult to support. However, in the 1860’s slavery was abolished. That didn’t mean the end of the ugliness forced on the people of color. The black race had been treated as less worthy of life and happiness than the white people, and it took a lot of years to change that supposition in the minds of the white folk, though I am not certain that it is completely accomplished even now. </p><p>My grandchildren have conveniences and medications that had not yet been discovered when I was their age. I, of course, had conveniences and medications that had not been available to my parents. Time actually does change things, and it sometimes changes in ways that we think are good, and sometimes changes are recognized as being very bad. The good things include the growth of knowledge by physicians, and those marvelous people who see beyond the “way we always did it” to make life more pleasant for everyone. Take dentistry for instance. </p><p>Dentists were not seen unless a person had a tooth ache. If there was no dentist, they, or someone else, pulled the bad tooth to relieve the pain. If the entire tooth was removed, the pain usually went away and the gum would, in turn, heal. However there would be a visible gap between teeth. When Aunt Helen lost most of her teeth, it was much simpler to pull all of them and replace them with a full set of false teeth. Partial bridges to replace missing teeth had not yet been invented. </p><p>Because my Dad had watched his sister suffer from having her teeth pulled at such an early age, he was determined to help me with my little problem. My lower jaw was not quite as long as my upper jaw and neither jaw was quite long enough to hold all my permanent teeth. When my baby teeth fell out, my permanent teeth grew in, and lapped over each other. My eye teeth looked like the tusks of an elephant sticking out under my upper lip on top of my other teeth. People noticed. I began to hold a hand in front of my mouth, especially when I was in the presence of children, or even adults, I didn’t know well. The only way to hide those weird looking teeth was with my hand over my mouth, and to my mother’s dismay I simply covered my mouth with my hand as if I was ashamed of my own face. I truly was a little girl who kept her mouth shut if at all possible. The problem was that my jaw was too short to hold all my teeth. </p><p>Dentistry was not new when I was a child, though filling teeth, and providing false teeth wasn’t all that old, either. There were a number of dentists in Charlotte when I was a child, but there were only two orthodontists. Those were doctors who could put pressure on certain teeth to make them realign themselves by using small wires. When my Dad found out about the possibility of an orthodontist being able to realign my teeth, he asked Mother to take me to see him. </p><p>The orthodontist told my mother he would have to pull some perfectly good teeth to make room for the others to be realigned. My Dad, having watched his sister struggle because she had lost so many teeth, said no. The doctor was kind. He tried for close to four years to realign my teeth. They now looked like they were almost ready to burst out of my gums. It had taken four full years. That kind doctor asked my Dad to come to see him, and this time after he talked to the doctor, he agreed that I could have four teeth pulled. Then the entire treatment began again as soon as my gums had healed after having the four teeth removed. This time, though it was not particularly easier than the other, I could at least see the progress. And four years later my teeth were properly spaced, and I finally had the braces removed. That day when I left his office I was so extremely happy that I wept. I decided I couldn’t ride a bus home, though I had an armful of school books. I walked, and smiled, and wept and smiled, and hurried and smiled and finally got home. I still looked normal. I didn’t have braces in my mouth after eight full years of wearing them. I had neither wire nor tusks under my lips. I was normal looking. So I smiled, and smiled, and smiled. And felt happy, and grateful to my parents for doing that for me, and thankful for the doctor who had helped me. </p><p>My Dad had been careful, and had not trusted the orthodontist simply because when he was growing up doctors had not really known what they were doing in many instances. Daddy’s little sister, named Stella, died because the Doctor couldn’t help her. Since there were so few effective remedies it probably wasn’t his fault, but it made my Dad place less trust in any doctor because of that experience. There had been no treatment, and no medicine to help his mother who was frail most of my Dad’s life. His sister, Helen, suffered from the treatment offered by her doctor when she was a teenager—all her teeth were ruined, and she was toothless by the time she was twenty years old. My Dad’s older brother was injured, and I was never aware of the circumstances, nor was I told how he was injured. However, afterwards he did not grow taller, and never was as strong as my Dad. Though my Dad was six feet three inches tall, my uncle was only about five feet two inches. Uncle Eddie was not nearly as strong as my Dad, and often asked my Dad to help him with harvest, even after Daddy married and had his own paint business. </p><p>The whole time I was growing up my Dad often helped with what he called the “laying by” time. That was the harvest time on the family farm. My Grandfather planted cotton, wheat, corn, melons, and vegetables, and in the flower garden there were a few herbs. There seemed to be few fruit trees, but there were several places along a creek that I saw only once, and there were nut trees near it. Aunt Helen kept chickens for eggs. The pigs turned into smoked meats and fats, and upon occasions the random rooster or pullet provided chicken dinners. Hay to feed the mule and the cows through the winter were harvested, so that very little in the way of food was actually bought from a store. The cows gave milk and butter. Only tea, salt, sugar and coffee, absolutely had to be bought from a store. Fruit pies were usually the desert at meal time, or if pie, or less likely, a cake, was not available, molasses or honey were usually available as a desert, with homemade butter and homemade wheat bread. </p><p>At my house as I was growing up, we had a marvelous thing. We had an ice box. It was not a refrigerator since those almost magic boxes made ice, but the ice box was a sort of special cabinet that could retard the melting of block ice, and keep meats from going bad and other food cooler than it would be on an ordinary shelf in the warm kitchen. The ice box slowed but could not actually prevent the ice from melting, and there was a drainage tube that went through the floor to carry away the water as the ice melted. Mother kept her butter, milk, and cooked foods, and uncooked meat in the ice box. In summer we could make iced tea, and our milk didn’t spoil when we kept it in the ice box. <br/> 8888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888 My aunts would can or dry what they could, and he , by that uncle was always skin and bones—very small, and not very strong. He was much smaller than my Dad, and far from being as strong as my Dad. He plowed and sowed the fields on their farm, and took care of the mule, the cows, and the pigs. But he certainly was never as strong as my Dad. I understood as a child that Granddaddy Yandle was the real farmer, and Uncle Eddie was his helper. After my Grandfather became too frail to actually do the field work, my Dad helped Uncle Eddie with some of the plowing, and sometimes left his own small business to help with haying, and harvesting, because there was no one else capable of bringing in the crops. </p><p>My Dad had because my Aunt Helen who was a teenager at the time, had once been given a medicine to drink that simply melted the outward layer of her teeth, and I don’t know what it did to her stomach. By the time she was twenty years all her teeth had been removed, and she was wearing false teeth. I never heard how long it took—weeks, months, years, for her to get the false teeth, and I never saw her without them. But I do know of a certainty that it took a mighty reason to pry her away from home. During my early childhood she did not go to church, she did not ever go to a store, she never went visiting, and she spent most of her time every day in the kitchen. Her “recreation” was feeding the chickens and feeding her dog, when she had one, and her cats, which lived under the house and kept rats away. </p><p>. she taken medicine once when she was only in her teen years, and the result of that was that all her teeth—every smack-dab one of them—had to be pulled, and she thereafter had false teeth. She was not even twenty years old when she lost all her teeth. </p><p>A physician had given her the medicine that ruined her teeth. A dentist had pulled her teeth and made her false teeth. Aunt Helen spent almost all of her life at home. She so rarely went away form home. It was true that her mother, my grandmother, needed constant attention because she was both feeble and blind. But Aunt Martha and Aunt Pauline, her sisters, and my Dad, who was her brother, had lives that stretched a long way from that little farm. My Dad was one of five children. He was the youngest boy, and Pauline was the youngest girl. that i</p><p>The first time I went to the dentist I was about twelve years old. This particular dentist wasn’t one who fixed cavities, or cleaned teeth. This doctor had a sign on the door of his office that said he was an orthodontist. He was one of two such doctors in Charlotte in the early 1940’s, at least as far as I knew. I had never before been to a dentist when my mother made the appointment. I knew that my Dad had visited a dentist who had pulled one of his teeth, and that made him feel bad for a day or two. This visit was an adventure to me, and though I was eager to improve my appearance, I was a little shy about beginning the treatment that I had heard was painful. I had never seen a person wearing tooth braces. Both my parents were willing to spend hard earned money to correct the way my teeth had grown in after my baby teeth disappeared. My eye teeth came out under my nose, above other teeth. </p><p>one of only two such doctors in the City of Charlotte at that time. He was an orthodontist. He realigned the teeth of children when their permanent teen had grown in crookedly, making their smile sometimes I wore braces for several years, young, had braces attached to my teeth. The need was quite visable to to straighten teeth that lapped over each other and grew out like elephant tusks. My mother told me that I formed a habit of covering my mouth with my hand when I laughed, because I was ashamed of the way my teeth had grown out. It bothered both of my parents enough that they sent me to an orthodontist and paid for my teeth to be straightened so that I would look more normal, and less like I was part elephant, with tusks. I was wonderfully grateful for their care. My Dad was particularly proud of the changes he saw when my teeth were eventually straight. I think it pleased him partly because he had an older sister, my Aunt Helen, who had lost all her teeth when she was eighteen years old. </p><p>When I was a child I was allowed to listen to most of the radio programs I wanted to hear. In those years broadcasters were subject to strenuous regulations of propriety. Stations—not just programs--could be forced off the air if they did not adhere to ordinary regulations about bad language, cursing, and implications of sexual abuse. Parents could, for the most part, allow their children to listen to radio programs with some assurance that they would not hear cursing, or mentions of explicit sex. </p><p>When I first began to watch television the rules of what could be shown were strict, as were the rules for radio. Motion pictures shown in theaters were also carefully monitored for decency. In the early days people wanted to be entertained in a pleasant but extremely “clean” way. If a person was drunk in a motion picture, it was usually meant to be funny, not tragic. Innocent children, that is children not yet informed about cursing and sex and the ugliest situations that too often occur in real life, were not to learn how base people could be when they were just plain mean, drunk, or depraved, and were so proud of it they didn’t care who knew it. Motion Pictures were monitored, and though I’m not sure what rules applied to television, it, too, was mostly carefully watched for crassness and ugliness. </p><p>There was one theater in Charlotte that often had Saturday morning specials, hoping to draw children in for the Saturday Matinee. In the evenings they showed provocative movies that “nice” people didn’t watch. The older theaters sometimes opened at ten o’clock or eleven o’clock on 9:00 A.M. with special children’s shows, or just the morning shows. Sometimes the picture changed after six or seven o’clock. Most of the movies shown in theatres were subject to rules of decency. In Charlotte the older theatres were less often filled on Saturdays or in the afternoons. Most theatres didn’t even open in the mornings. Because most people had to work, and most work was done in the daytime, there were few people able to spend time in a theatre. Saturdays were different. Saturdays were movie days for school age people who were out of school on Saturday and Sunday. young people who did not have to go to school. Almost everyone went to The older the theatre, the The filthy movies were usually shown in run down movie houses where the floors and the seats were actually unclean, and where the restrooms were usually filthy. The water fountains even looked dirty. I know because I entered such a theater once when I was about twelve or thirteen to see a popular movie I had missed when it had played months before in another theatre. That was the day I decided to be more careful about where—not so much why—but where I went, especially if I was going alone. That day I learned that entertainment which I had always thought was good fun, wasn’t always either fun or safe. I was certain that shabby was not always evil, nor was evil always shabby. </p><p>people too often found themselves involved in. sometimes would not learn bad language or what was then called “the facts of life” without parental consent. **be harmed the was also quite reliable as proper and clean language and portrayals. I can remember once when severe weather was passing through Charlotte that the weather announcer used a phrase on the air that was the punch line of a tawdry joke. Both my husband and I reacted to hearing it, looking at each other in surprise and disgust. The very next day the man was fired. About twenty years later I was up in the wee hours of the night, needing to calm my dismay at the illness of a family member. I thought that if I could sit quietly to watch an old movie it might help me relax so that I could fall asleep. When I switched on the television set hoping to find an interesting old movie, I picked an inopportune moment. To my surprise, on the screen was a similitude of a married couple deeply involved with each other. Granted it was about one o’clock in the morning, and the camera concentrated on their faces, however it was a rather large shot and I decided without hesitation that if that was the current fare offered on late night television I would never again use that medium to soothe my stressfulness. That very night I selected a book from a box I had pulled out from my closet. Then I piled my pillows against the headboard of my bed and read a book that took me away from myself long enough to calm my mind, to allow me to relax into sleep. The old book that did not distress me was much more soothing to the personal distress because of my Mother’s illness. <br/> 88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888</p><p>Time never stands still, even if it seems to pause. The speed of accomplishments, the quick responses of today, could not have been achieved when I was a child. The equipment did not exist at that time. I realize that life today, right now, is very different from the way almost every American lived it in the 1930’s. Not only has medicine, travel, communications, building, education, and every facet of life changed, time itself seems different. There are more people in the world. There are more people in this country. Moving from one location to another is much easier to do now than when I was a child. Food kept fresh for more than a day was risky when I was a child. Now, storing food safely is much easier. Communications between people some distance apart is now possible. </p><p>Mostly because of electricity and the machines and methods of communication we use today, the people of all nations living on the entire planet called Earth can communicate together to solve problems or cope with natural disasters. Much more can be accomplished in a day than was possible when I was a child. The length of the day has not changed, but methods of accomplishing most necessary tasks have improved astronomically. </p><p>the rules most folk adhered to when I was young. Some changes are, of course, the most wonderful thing that could happen. Among the most wonderful things were the medicines to fight illness, and the medical procedures that can save lives, the speed with which help can reach vulnerable folk and the marvelous ways that now can warn of foul weather, or dangerous situations. Having been born in 1931 (which makes me seventy-five years old as I write this) there were no antibiotics beyond sulfa until Pennicillin was discovered. Should persons of any age became ill before the 1940’s, they could be sure that one of two things would happen: they would die, or they would survive. If they died, they would have no problems in this world. If they survived, they found themselves in one of at least two situations: they would be either as well as they had ever been, or they would bear some form of discomfort or lack of movement or ability for the rest of their lives. </p><p>Judging from the experiences of my grandparents, especially in their younger years, accidents and illnesses often took adult lives. There were lots of people on the earth then—but not nearly as many as there are today. Lives were seldom as long in those days as they are now. , leaving children without parents. Sometimes parents saw their children become ill and die despite their efforts to help them. There were no antibiotics. In the time of my grandparents childbirth was a danger that often took the lives of the mother and the baby, or simply one or the other. If the baby survived, it required milk. If there was no cow or goat milk and if there was no other nursing mother close by who could feed both her own and motherless child, the motherless child usually did not live. In many instances mil from cows or goats was t was not available from cows, goats, or a substitute mother, it, too, would die. both the babies and the mothers. when children became ill, they usually died. There were no antibiotics and few doctors. Communication was generally by horseback, and doctors had no effective medicines to use. Prayer, Bed rest, good food, careful nursing, and a strong physical constitution were the best remedies. It was rare that a really life-threatening disease left no sign of its damages on its victim. <br/> as diminished by the illness and they would have to grin and bear their diminished health for the balance of their lives, or they might not live through the illness andeither got well without medicines, or they died, or they lived the balance of their lives less able to cope with their everyday lives because they were physically maimed by some illness. </p><p>towever, thanks to the fact that not all entertainments are dedicated to making life better and more beautiful. In many cases today entertainment is digging into filthiness to be sensational enough to make a lot more money, encouraging people to if it were than a nice production that would simply entertain and please its audiences. </p><p>. , because not everything you see on television is even decent nor is it truthful and educational. not available to me </p><p>something about me. Actually while I was writing , my husband, and even perhaps our parents. Since I have been trying to find truthful names of old folk I am a little upset that those I once loved and interacted with are fading from my memory, and that there are now no persons I can question to be sure everything is correct. Therefore I won’t tell anyone that everything I shall write is without the occasional error caused by loss of memory, or a muddled remembrance that is not quite accurate. I shall, of course, do my best.<br/> _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</p><p>I suspect every person in the world would like to be remembered by people he or she loved and cared for—such as siblings, cousins, children, grandchildren, and all even folk we met for a limited time but who meant something in my life. the people , but I suspect at least part of my thinking and remembering is a little bit of nostalgia, perhaps a wish to remind my self of some of the exciting times in my life, some of the important times, perhaps times when it was obvious that I was part of something useful, beautiful, happy, or maybe even a little bit wonderful for people other than myself. I, just like almost everybody else, like to know that the world is a better place and the people I love are in better circumstances than they might have been because of something I said, or did, or planned for, or accomplished when our lives touched, no matter how briefly it might have been, or how unimportant it may have seemed at the time. </p><p>Actually, when I began to try to remember my early life, I started with scanty memories of my early childhood, and as I progressed down the years I remembered people, and places, events, occurrences, and began to enjoy a walk down memory lane. Often names escaped me, though faces still linger in my mind. That is especially true of the first job I held after I graduated from college. However, I cannot now say, “Oops, I better hit replay and write down the names.” That works only when the past is on tapes and recordings, and I wasn’t using them when I was doing such ordinary things. Time, in and of itself, doesn’t usually give us a lot of second or third chances to relive even beautiful experiences. Anyway—the following is, in the beginning, about me, and later on I wrote down things my husband of fifty some odd years has told me about his childhood and youth, and about himself before I met him. There are also remembrances from our early marriage, our lives together, our children, and now our grandchildren. I hope all the folk who read it enjoy again the lovely times I remember, and the beautiful times I had with all of them. It may be that some experience I write down will prevent their making the same mistakes I made. I hope you will enjoy reading about that period of time, and walking with me down through my past, in years that are now called “long ago.” I did so enjoy the happy times. </p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>                Iris Jean Yandle
</code></pre></div><p>My earliest memories are sketchy, as they are for most people. Babies do not usually remember the first time someone washes their hair, or feeds them, and I suppose all of the necessary and expected events occurred. My only access to my earliest beginnings are memories of what my parents and/or my older sister told me, and though my mother told me lots of little things, my sister didn’t bother, and I couldn’t really blame her for her attitude toward me. Her dislike didn’t come from anything I did or didn’t do. Her dismay at my arrival occurred because in that time it was customary to protect young children from any knowledge of why Mommy had a bigger tummy than she used to have, and the likelihood was good that a little brother or sister would be appearing one day soon so that there would be a new member of the family. That practice, with the best of motives, must have made a lot of problems for a lot of children, and for a while, my sister was one of them.</p><p>My sister, at the age of six, had no hint that quite soon the number of persons in her family might increase by at least one person. One morning she found herself taken over to a neighbor’s house. Because she liked the neighbor, named Pauline Funderburk, she had a good time while she was there. Like most six year old children she didn’t demand an explanation about why she stayed overnight with Pauline because the dictum that “children should be seen and not heard” was prevalent at the time. She trusted the grownups to always do the right thing and always take good care of her. Therefore, there were a couple of days she didn’t even see her mother. Of course, her Dad stopped by to make sure that all was well with her, and that Mrs. Funderburk didn’t need anything for Ella Cornelia. It was not actually an ordinary situation as Ella Cornelia had almost always stayed at home. She was not dumb, and she knew the situation was kind of odd, but she was not frightened, nor was she unhappy. She liked Pauline. There had been no hint that events were occurring that would change Ella Cornelia’s home life forever. No one mentioned the possibility that little Ella Cornelia was soon to discover she had a small sister or brother. She was enjoying her stay with Pauline. Her Dad even stopped by to be sure she didn’t need any thing from home. Ella Cornelia had often visited Pauline’s house for short periods, and though she hadn’t spent the night there before, she was having a good time. </p><p>Of course, within a day or so she discovered the reason why she was staying with Pauline Funderburk Pauline took little Ella Cornelia home, still not knowing why she had stayed with Pauline in the first place. </p><p>Not everyone understands the word surprise. A surprise could be anything from a doll to a new dress or to a scrumptious treat, and during that time (1931) in the South a surprise was usually a joyous experience for a child. My sister was willing to accept whatever it was that was due to her, because it was almost always a fun thing, or a good thing. Maybe it was a new dress, or perhaps some other treat, and therefore she was eager to go home. She had lots of nice expectations, and it was lovely to think about Upon arriving home she went through the door, walked into the room, and sure enough Mother was there and there was a surprise. </p><p>The actual surprise was me. And Ella Cornelia was surprised, alright. The other folk there were also surprised. In that day and time parents did not usually tell the children in the family that a new baby was expected. Parents often hid the fact that another child was on the way. Therefore when our Mom came home from the hospital she did have a surprise for Ella Cornelia who had no idea that I was born. She had been six years old for several months, and immediately realized that there was a car in front of her house. When my Ella Cornelia went inside the house, she saw her mother sitting with a baby in her arms. Lots of people were there, though at my tender age at that time I, myself, didn’t recognize any of them. What I know is that when Ella Cornelia learned that she had been sent away to stay with Pauline Funderburk so that Mother could have a baby, and that the surprise was only me, my sister wanted to give me back to the hospital. It took her a lot of years to finally decide that I could stay, after all.</p><p>At first, Ella Cornelia’s reaction was that she had been tricked. She really didn’t want a sister. She had been the only child all her life. Now people were visiting me—not my sister. I was the new one. People would come in and say something like “Hello, Ella Cornelia, where is the Baby?” Then they might even have a gift for the newborn, and not for Ella Cornelia. </p><p>all the attention. The people in the room weren’t excited about seeing Ella Cornelia. They wanted Ella Cornelia to be excited about the baby. Everyone there was pleased and expecting her to be happy, too. Ella Cornelia did not leave them in suspense over her reaction. She said with all her six year old power, “TAKE IT BACK.” <br/> It took a while to make clear to her that I was non-returnable.</p><p>My sister, an intelligent child, had truly enjoyed being an only child, and also reveled in the fact that she was the only Yandle grandchild. Ella Cornelia had also been the first born Parks grandchild, but in that family she was definitely not the only child. Mother’s brother Dennis, a little older than my mother, married a lovely lady named Mary. Uncle Dennis and Aunt Mary married earlier than my Mother and Dad, however Ella Cornelia was also the first born grandchild in my mother’s family. However, after Ella Cornelia’s birth, and before my appearance in our family, Uncle Dennis and Aunt Mary had three children. Dennis, Jr., was the oldest, and then came Patsy, and then Mary Cole. </p><p>My mother had two brothers. The oldest one was named Luther. He married a lady who was a true Southern Belle. She owned a house that had belonged to her family for many years, and she and Uncle Luther seemed to be happy, and they spoke as if they really enjoyed living in that historical house. Because they lived so far away from Pineville we saw them less often than we did the kin folk who lived closer to Charlotte. Many years later, when I was old, and Uncle Luther’s wife had passed away, he returned to the Pineville area, and lived with Aunt Ola and her husband Vance Davis, until he died. He brought to each of his nieces a couple of very old, but very nice chairs that had been used in the very old house where Uncle Luther had lived for so long. Uncle Luther went to a lot of trouble to sand and refinish those chairs, and he gave two to all of his nieces. I still have mine. </p><p>My sister was an alert child, an active child, a thinking child. She had always been in the very center of the total attention of the family as the only grandchild in the Yandle family, and the first grandchild in the Parks families as well. Of course, she knew about the birth of her three Parks’ cousins, and had seen them when they visited her Parks Grandparents at the same time she did, and they didn’t seem to be a threat. It was different on the Yandle side of the family. She was an only child, and an only grandchild on that side of the family. It always puzzled me that she didn’t mind her three Parks cousins visiting her Parks Grandparents. Somehow those children didn’t seem to be a threat to her. I was different. I was right there, right in her mother’s arms, and in the very center of the other people that were in the house. the middle of her own home. </p><p>I was different, however, because I was right there in the middle of her home, in her mother’s arms, and she was told that from now on she was a big sister. For my sister there had been no indication of the expected event, no hint that a baby was coming into the family. In those days, “nice” people didn’t talk about such private things to small children. And therefore, I was an unwelcome surprise to Ella Cornelia. I was, so far as she was concerned, stealing her place as the youngest child. I was definitely the center of attraction. People who came into the house would say a casual hello to her, and then coo over the baby, and say nice things about the new child. She saw it as a defeat for her, and an intrusion on my part. Ella Cornelia had been an only child for a little over six years. I was a blunt, unwelcome addition to the family. She was an intelligent child and she recognized immediately that she had competition. The guests were not looking at her—they were looking at the new baby. It was difficult for her to understand that she had competition where other people were concerned. no longer an only child. She, who had always been the very center of attraction suddenly wasn’t. Everyone wanted to see the new baby. N=Most of the aattention and interest and attention at home and with her Yandle grandparents as well, and since Grandmother Yandle had been very ill, she was visited more often than Grandmother Parks. </p><p>She didn’t see her young Parks cousins very often, because in the </p><p>. Suddenly, without a thinking child. warning, she had competition. not in any dimension a dumb child. , . She immediately realized my arrival changed everything because she was no longer an only child. She immediately surmised that family and neighbors might begin to “like” the new baby better than they liked her, because all of them were gathered around the new baby, right now! Most of them gave her a nod, but all they were interested in was seeing the new baby, and perhaps noticing her reaction to meeting her baby sister for the first time. Whether or not they were really interested in how she reacted to seeing her sweet baby sister for the first time, and learning that she actually had a sweet little baby sister, it probably had not occurred to them that this was not so much a pleasing present for a small child as it was an unwelcome shock to an barely six year old who had not had even a clue to the manner in which her life was forever changing. She was not stupid. She saw that the people present, every smack-dab one of them, placed all their interest on the new baby. They were expecting pleasure from her, too. , as if it were not a total shock to her, and a fear that the new baby would get all the attention, They girlTherefore, they were not paying much attention to the little person who had hitherto been the only important child. She was completely vulnerable since she had never before had an actual rival where attention was concerned, especially in the Yandle side of the family. </p><p>The only other “grandchildren” in the family were the two children of her Uncle Dennis Parks who was her mother’s brother and who lived in Fort Mill, South Carolina. Since they lived about twenty miles away from the Parks Grandparents, they didn’t come to North Carolina often. Uncle Dennis worked six days a week, and was active in their church. The date was after and probably his younger sister who was not yet walking. It was probably a sort of coincidence that Uncle Dennis and Mother didn’t often show up at the same time to visit the Parks Grandparents, and a boy toddler wasn’t much of a threat, even when he had a very small sister who was probably close to two years older than of her Yandle grandparents she was an only child. In the Parks family there was a child just a little bit younger than herself, and though she had played with him a little, she had not found him a rival to her position as the first grandchild in both families. Little Dennis, Junior was about a year and a half younger than her, so that even if there were two grandchildren in that family, she was still the older, which made her the boss. Little Dennis was not really a threat, and visits to the Parks grandparents didn’t seem to be a problem when they were together. Uncle Dennis and Aunt Mary lived in Fort Mill, South Carolina, and he was younger than her, which made her the boss. He didn’t come to visit very often when they were both very young, and the two children seemed to play well together. But Dennis, Junior was not a surprise to a six year old only child. Little baby Jean was a total surprise. Visitors paid attention to the new baby, and came close to ignoring young Ella Cornelia. Shock can breed anger very quickly and sometimes permanently. It took about ten years before my sister could find even one tiny thing about me that she liked. My memory of the turn-around was based on music. She liked to sing. I could carry a tune. Therefore, washing dishes by hand, rinsing them, drying them, putting them away was boring. It went quicker with help. Even a young kid sister could dry dishes. The radio did ot always someone to dry (boring) went quickingand unwelcomeBecause Dennis, Jr. was not a surprise, and he was o.k. to play with because he lived in South Carolina and wasn’t around very much. </p><p>However, this baby was not going to be tucked into a car and carried away when it began to be dark. Her parents were going to keep this little baby, right in her own house. Ella Cornelia was not dumb, and she had already discovered that “other” little girls and boys could interrupt the attention lavished on her. </p><p>Not only had she not expected so huge a disappointment as a little baby sister, she, who had recently celebrated her n “only” child, an only grandchild, in the Yandle family. In the Parks family she was an “only” child in one family, and she had become accustomed to the fact that she had a slightly younger boy cousin who was the son of her mother’s brother and his wife, and there was even a younger girl baby named Patsy who was Dennis Junior’s little sister. They didn’t visit often since they lived in Fort Mill. . in the other family, because he lived in Fort Mill, South Carolina, and in that day and time, travel wasn’t as easy as it is now, with automobiles one of two grandchildren iand cousin on the Yandle side of the family. Now she had a real “bugger man” in her own house. </p><p>As a matter of fact, she disliked me so much she suggested that life would be much better for our parents, and for her, if my mother took me back to the place where she found me, and leave me there. I was unexpected, unwelcome, and a mighty nuisance to my sister from the day I arrived home until I was about ten years old. </p><p>When I was born my parents were living in Charlotte, North Carolina. They rented a couple of rooms from my Dad’s Aunt Elizabeth Yandle and her brother Edward. I honestly don’t know how that brother and sister were related to me. They were brother and sister to my Grandfather Yandle. Uncle Edward and Aunt Elizabeth didn’t talk unless they had something to say. That is, they didn’t join in conversations just to wag their tongues. If they had something to say, that politely mentioned it. However they would never have interrupted anyone else who was talking. They never told jokes. They never spoke nonsense. If someone asked a question they would answer it. Had they witnessed a house on fire, they would have waited politely until someone asked them if they had seen it, and then they would have said, “yes.” They were not eager to tell what they knew about anything. They seldom found it necessary to begin a conversation. When they visited, us there was never to jabber about whatever the subject might be </p><p>, but they were not , on East Fifth Street. The house numbers were usually three digits, with the first number indicating and the first number assigned to each house was the number of the block. The five hundred block was the fifth block from Tryon Street, and the and the following number or numbers were different for each house. . All the houses in that block had a number that began with five. blocks from either Tryon Street (the north-south streets) or from Trade Street (the east west streets). Though so far as I know the East Fifth Street still exists, none of the houses I remember are still standing. When I was a child I think the Telephone Company—the place where the operators were, and the place to which all the lines in the city were attached was there on that street. </p><p>numbers were in the 500’s . I remember that mother told me that when my older sister, Ella Cornelia, was a baby, she and Daddy lived with my Great Aunt Elizabeth and Uncle Edward. I was much older when I realized that they were the sister and brother of my grandfather Yandle. I was very young when I began to remember what they looked like, and how they behaved, and even when I was a very small child, I thought they didn’t match the rest of the family. They lived differently, dressed differently, seemed to have different vocabularies from the rest of my Dad’s family, but also seemed to be extremely welcome when they visited. It wasn’t until I was grown that I realized that they had been born at slightly later date than my Granddaddy, and that their upbringing was different because they had a different mother. Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward were kind, but sticklers for “the right way to do things” and had an accent different form ours. I think it their mother must have been more recently British because of the precise way they spoke the King’s English. Both were well educated. I knew very little about them, and saw little of them, though Uncle Edward would stop by our house upon occasion. He was a door to door salesman, who carried a suitcase filled with mentholatum, shoe strings, and other items that people needed every day. I remember his suitcase, and some of the things he sold, and that he didn’t talk exactly like my other uncles. He always wore a suit, and wore a hat out-of-doors. He had a different vocabulary from everybody else I knew. I do remember one day he stopped by our house. I didn’t see either of my Aunt and Uncle very frequently, and I, as a very small child, didn’t really enjoy visiting them at their house, because the house was quite old. Some things about it were interesting—such as the fact that it had not only one way to light the house after dark, but two ways. There were old fashioned gas lights in every room, and there were also electric lights in the house. In their front room there was a settee, and on the other side of the room, there was a pump organ. I had seen pianos in some homes, and I had also seen pump organs. However no one else in our family had either one. </p><p>In those times there was a phrase, or maybe it could be called a sentence, I hated to hear put into words, no matter how quietly or discretely. I usually heard it when I was actually or almost the only child in the room, and the grownups were saying very interesting things and using words I didn’t easily recognize. If I was bold enough to ask for clarification, my sister, my parents, or someone who knew me quite well, would lean over and whisper: “Children should be seen and not heard!” That usually meant the end of the conversation until I left the room. I always felt belittled as a person. They didn’t trust me. They didn’t like me. They kept secrets from me when I found their subject interesting. Since I was the youngest child in the family the idea of my growing up, my being savvy of what they were talking about could mean I was no long a baby, but that made them, each and every one of them, older, too. I seemed to be always hearing that at Aunt Lizzie’s house. My biggest worry was whether or not they thought I was trustworthy, and the answer I figured out was no, they didn’t trust me about much of anything. They didn’t even like it if I wanted to bang on the pump organ if I was in the room by myself. </p><p>If whatever the adults were talking about had caught my interest that phrase was two things: it always meant “shut-up or you will be in deep trouble”, and it usually reminded any careless adults that a child was present and should not be exposed to whatever was being discussed. If I was intrigued, and wanted a word explained, many times someone told me what I wanted to know, but sometimes I would hear that sentence, and it never failed to cause me genuine dismay. If I didn’t understand the gist of the conversation I felt I deserved a tiny bit of clarification. However, if the grownups were making an effort to talk “above” me, satisfying themselves with knowing looks, but keeping me out of the knowledge of the real meaning I felt diminished and knew they didn’t trust me. It never occurred to me that living a life could hold rules of polite conversation that allowed privacy in sticky situations, or offered protection to people who needed to be sheltered from words. </p><p>that they didn’t trust me as a person. They thought I would tell the wrong people. it was not that they were being niceand therefore keep me in ignorance of what they were actually talking about, . I always have liked to talk with other people. we were in a crowd, someone would whisper in my ear seven words I was never proud I didn’t mind visiting Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Edward, though they were different in the way they looked and thought. I could not easily predict what they would say, or what they were thinking. Their accents were different from those of the rest of my family. However, my parents, and my Dad’s parents, my aunts, my uncle, and people I didn’t even know treated him as if he were a valuable friend. Being about five or six years old when I began to make my own judgments about grown-ups, I decided there had to be something about that man that I was too young to understand. made my own When they spoke it was generally in complete sentences. They did not chatter. They were perfectly happy to sit in a room with several people and not say a word. However, Uncle Edward was well educated, and he had what I called a marvelous vocabulary, and when I was older . a lot, I found them strange in some ways. Uncle Ed never spoke unless he had a definite something to say. He never made an effort to wiggle his tongue in “small talk” had no small talk—empty sounds without true merritthem, but they lived very near a railroad track, and the street itself was busy, mostly because Southern Bell had a large building there. old and the houses were old. My mother said the houses in that area were dingy, mostly from train smoke and soot. Probably all had once been owned by the people who lived there, however, time and soot from the trains, and <strong><em>*</em></strong>****but the houses were so old that many occupants had rented space in them after the original folks had died, and their heirs didn’t want to move in. </p><p>Most of them were, by the time I was born, rental houses, because their owners had become old and moved out, or they had died and no one in their families wanted to live there. The nearby elementary school had sections that were unsafe for classes, and the students were not allowed in those areas. and most of the houses were a little </p><p>them really often. That day he arrived just after we sat down to lunch. Of course, my mother asked him to join us. His reply was that “I have no room.” Since our table was smallish, and the four of us were in our normal places, the old gentleman was correct—there was no place set for him. Therefore my mother hurriedly arose from her chair, made a place for him at the table, then pulled up another chair for Uncle Edward, and asked him again to join us at table. Uncle Edward chuckled, and said, “I meant, in my alimentary canal.” My mother had to explain to me that he meant he had already eaten, and had no room in his tummy for more food. </p><p>had be born and educated in England, and that they were children of a second marriage. One Great grandfather married twice. My grandfather was born of his first wife. After her death, Great Grandfather married again, and Uncle Edward and Aunt Elizabeth were the children of the second wife.</p><p>Our house had a lovely front porch, my earliest yearslittle bit of trying to recognize important events that I believe are worth recording within written words, and a least a little bit of boredom because I dislike doing nothing. I don’t have any riveting chores, or fascinating errands; therefore I would like to have an important goal, something that will be appreciated by people other than myself. Therefore, I shall type, and I will try to write down how it was in the early 1930’s and how it was for me and to some extent to my family, some of whom none of my Grandchildren ever met. They were strong people, and in many cases very good and noble folk. In my family only my sister remembers some of the things I can remember. She was born in 1925, and at this time is still living in Charlotte. She married Harry May after World War II, and they had five children, who are cousins to my daughter and son. My kids don’t know my sister’s kids very well at all, having seen them only a Christmas or birthdays when they were small. Therefore, once I began the letter to my Grandson who lives all the way across the country in Oregon, </p><p>and I have always been long winded. Not only that, I get carried away when I begin to write, and I ramble and digress, and start over again, and then get frustrated and either toss the whole thing, or try to write a whole book. This time it looks like I started a book—and I hope you, and probably the rest of the family will enjoy it. If I can stick to my task I will eventually finish my task. I promise I will certainly try! </p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>                    ***
</code></pre></div><p>When Paw-paw was in high school (he graduated in 1943) he didn’t choose to learn typing as I did. Typewriters of that day and time were mostly manual, not electric, and there were very few male students who wanted to learn typewriting. Their decision was based on an absolutely known fact: Most of the young males in school in those days expected to become boss of something, a superior person in a business. Therefore, he would dictate orders and letters. The females would type them. It was a gender thing. </p><p>Paw-paw’s schooling was not very different from mine. He was born in the month October in the year of l925, and was an only child. The plan did not begin with only one child, because when Paw-paw was four or five years old his parents expected another child. Sadly, that child did not live. His umbilical cord circled his neck so tightly during his birth that he never began to breathe. Paw-paw therefore became an only child. </p><p>As an infant, Paw-paw and his parents lived in a quiet neighborhood but not a “modern” one. When he was still quite small, perhaps two or quite close to three years old, his parents moved onto a reasonably quiet street not far from Mercy Hospital, where several other young families of their acquaintance already lived. The street was lined with nice, modern houses with a number of young families, including children close to Bobby’s age, who were iving there. Paw-paw, who was called Bobby, was growing up in a spacious house built just like his parents wanted it built. They furnished the house as they wished, and it had a modern kitchen, with a dish washer (yes, they did have them way back then) and their house stood among other modern homes. There were young families nearby, with companions for little Bobby. He enjoyed playing with them, and one child, he discovered, was a cousin. </p><p>When Bobby was almost six he enrolled in the first grade at a nearby school. His birthday was October 25, and since school usually began in early September, there was a problem. In the eyes of the City of Charlotte’s School Board, little Bobby Beatty was too young to enroll in the first grade. He was expected to wait until next year. However, his Mama thought he was bright enough to begin school that year, and that a single week, or perhaps two, shouldn’t matter very much, so she made a “mistake” and told the teacher that her little boy was born a little earlier than his actual birth date and little Bobby Beatty became a first grade student. Sometime later, of course, the “error” about his birth date was corrected. Little Bobby attended Elizabeth Grammar School, which was within easy walking distance from his home, and there were other students who lived quite near him who also walked the few blocks to the school. He liked his school, and his teachers, and played nicely with neighbor children. He even decided that he would marry one of the little girls, and couldn’t see why he should not, even though she was a cousin. However, he was only six at the time. </p><p>Paw-paw attended the Elizabeth school for several years, but when he was about ten years old, his family moved away from that neighborhood, and that is another part of this story. </p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>                                                              ********
</code></pre></div><p>My maiden name was Yandle. When I was old enough to attend school I discovered that my surname was a bit odd to most people. Even so, there were a few other students in the schools I attended with the same name, pronounced the same way, but usually spelled a little differently. There were several deviations: Yandal, Yandell, Yandel, and Yeandal. Our family spelled it: Yandle. When I was growing up, my Dad would sometimes talk about his family, and I heard stories of his parents, his siblings, and his childhood, along with grandparents, and numerous cousins. He spoke of his Grandfather, for whom my Dad had great respect. Daddy told a story to me when I was very young about the Fiftieth Wedding Anniversary celebration for his grandparents. At the golden anniversary celebration for his grandparents, my Dad who was a boy at the time My Dad had great respect for Milas Milton Yandle, and that event was a milestone that my Dad remembered with some relish, and with a lesson he learned that lasted all of his life. </p><p>A Fiftieth Wedding celebration was being held for Grandfather and his wife, and many family members had been invited, and so many had arrived that not all could eat at one time. Therefore, at the appointed time the number of folk who could sit around the table at the same time was then served the meal. When they had eaten their fill, they left the table, and it was prepared again, and again, until all the older folk had been fed. The children, and there were lots of them, had been told to wait until the adults had been fed before they came to the table. That nicety made for some hungry children who had no plan of how to spend all that time until they were called to eat. Therefore the boy children did what boy children always do when they are hungry, and have to wait a long while to be fed—they entertained themselves with a bit of mischief. In the house was a box of cigars, a present to Grandfather on his anniversary. It was a big box, and it had been opened, and several cigars had already been taken from the box. </p><p>One brave boy slipped into the room where the cigar box had been placed, and took one—only one—of the cigars and a match to light it, and then rejoined the other boys. Hungry boys who knew each other quite well decided to smoke the cigar while they waited. They went around the barn so as to be out of sight of the house. Once the cigar was lighted they took turns having a puff. It was a new and exciting and thoroughly grown-up experience, though it didn’t take much time to discover that it made them sort of queasy. By the time they were finally called to the table for their meal, the servers, though sort of surprised that the hungry boys did not demand double and triple helpings, didn’t worry about their appetites. The boys hardly ate what was placed on their first plate. The servers were surprised, but were probably grateful that the last table of guests did not prolong the final meal, and without much inquiry about uneaten food, they hurriedly did their clean-up so that they, too, could go join the visitors. </p><p>Towards sunset those visitors who had a considerable distance to cover to get home began to say their farewells and thanks and prepared to leave long before dark, as they would be traveling either on, or behind horses or mules. Those the longest distance from home would leave earliest as some, perhaps all, of those families had cows and horses or mules along with pigs and chickens to take care of before they themselves could rest for the night. Morning was always early on a farm. Therefore, the ladies who had served the meal were pleased to sit for a while before seeing their guests out to their buggies and wagons as they left for their trip home. My Dad never said whether or not the servers were surprised at how little of the food was eaten by the boys who had smoked the cigar. He did say that he could eat little of it. However, the tired servers didn’t complain when the youths had finished their meal rather quickly. They finished cleaning the kitchen and tried to find a place to sit down to rest and to enjoy the company, even though the guests were beginning to diminish as they left for home. Almost all of the visitors had, not only a distance to travel by wagon or buggy, but all of them would have also have had their own live stock to feed, cows to milk, and chickens and pigs and the horses or mules to feed and water. No matter how tired the older visitors were when they arrived home, they couldn’t ignore their animals. All of them would arise early the next day to a full workday. </p><p>I didn’t hear very much about some of those kin folk who were there for the Fiftieth Anniversary of my Dad’s grandparents. By the time I was born, in 1931, Milas Milton and his wife Sally Elizabeth had been deceased for years. Milas had married Sally Elizabeth Yandle about 1859, and their Golden Wedding Anniversary was celebrated in 1909, when they were both quite elderly. About that time my Dad was a teenager and he would, during World War I, be old enough to serve in the Navy. He had photographs of himself in China, and in other locations as he carried out his enlistment. As a child I was always intrigued by one of the photographs he had carried home. There was a cat on his ship which was named Bugs. My dad had thought enough of the cat to take its picture. I thought pets were wonderful, and I often enjoyed a peek at that photograph, and those of my tall Daddy among other sailors. It is possible that my sister still has those photos, because as the oldest she inherited many of the keepsakes that had been dear to Mother and Daddy. </p><p>When I was small it was always amazing to me to think of my strong, tall Dad as a small boy. I wasn’t stupid. I knew that children grew to become adults. But my Dad was so tall and so strong. As for me, it seemed to be taking an extremely long time for me to grow. My Dad’s escapades as a boy seemed to indicate that he was not a small boy—he was a big boy. It puzzled me that I was so very small. I fell easily. I didn’t mean to do it, but I dropped things. When I did I would get fussed at, and when I was small my big sister made it plain that she didn’t like me very much—which is not really unexpected. In those days birthing a child was a hush, hush, matter. And when I was expected no one told my sister. I was a surprise, but not a welcome one so far as she was concerned. She had been an “only” child for seven years, and then suddenly, without any warning, our mother brought home a little baby. People came to see me. When I became the focus of attention instead of the well known child called Ella Cornelia, she was not only unpleased, but actually angry that I even existed. If she had been able to do it, she would have sent me back quickly and permanently. </p><p>To think that my Dad ever suffered those same kind of feelings was difficult for a small child. My Dad was the youngest boy in his family, and his sister, Pauline, was the youngest child. My Dad’s older brother, Uncle Eddie, didn’t resemble my Dad very much. He had sustained a mule kick when he was small, and seemed never to grow as strong as his siblings. I was amazed when Uncle Eddie would ask my Dad how to make something work, or how to actually accomplish what he needed to do. He was the older brother, but it he seemed very different from my Dad. My Dad was big and tall. He was not fat—just a big man, well muscled and strong. Uncle Eddie was not taller than his sisters, and he was thinner than his sisters. Uncle Eddie lived at home with his parents and all three of his sisters until Aunt Pauline was married. He wore blue overalls, and I never saw him outside without a cap or a straw hat. </p><p>In those days many people who liked tobacco used snuff. Fine ground tobacco was sold in small silvery cans, and all you needed to do to get a “snuff brush” was to find a particular tree, and pick some slender pieces from the end of the limbs. One end of the little round stick would bristle out, sort of like a tiny rough broom, and when it was damp, a touch of the powdered tobacco would stick to the brush, and the user could put it against his or her cheek, and the flavor of the tobacco mixed with saliva would, in most instances, please the user. It could not be swallowed, and eventually the user would have to spit out the dark brown mess being held against their cheek. Usage of Tobacco snuff was not beautiful, because of the spitting. Folks usually used a tin can to spit in. When someone continually used snuff he or she would occasionally miss the can. It splattered where it fell. If cleaned up right away it didn’t leave a dark spot. If some tobacco stuck to the users lips, it looked nasty. If it spilled on their shirts it looked nasty. If a child accidentally kicked a spit can some one had left sitting on the floor close to the leg of a chair—it was a very bad move, and a very messy one. Spilling someone’s tobacco juice made the person who kicked it, and the person who set it down, very, very unhappy. </p><p>My uncle Eddie liked to smoke cigarettes better than he liked to use snuff. However, he was the only one in the family who smoked. My Dad, who was six feet three inches tall, always said he was not yet big enough to smoke. No one in my immediate family ever adopted the habit. </p><p>Aunt Pauline, my Dad’s baby sister, married Henry Hunnycut, and I don’t remember anything about the wedding. I was probably about five or six years old about then, and knew little about weddings. I liked Uncle Henry, as he smiled often, but didn’t talk much, at least to me. I have a faint remembrance of claiming him as my boyfriend, and arguing with Aunt Pauline whether I, myself, or she, would be marrying him. Most often when we visited Grandmother <br/> . <br/> As a child, I had lots of aunts and uncles, even though none of my Dad’s sisters had married until Aunt Pauline married Uncle Henry when I was about six years old. My Dad, Leroy Yandle, and his sister, my Aunt Pauline Hunnycut (ne. Yandle) were the only ones of that generation to marry until I was about seventeen years old. </p><p>There was a family that lived quite close to Aunt Pauline, and his mother was terminally ill. He was upset, and unhappy, and often visited my Grandmother Yandle’s house. The family name was Estridge, and I didn’t know any of them, nor did I ever learn how long they had lived there, or if my aunts and uncles knew the people at all. But one Sunday when I was about sixteen, we visited my grandparents there was a young man in the house, also visiting. I wondered why in the world a young man about twenty years old (or less) would hang around people he didn’t know very well who were much, much older than he was. I learned that his mother had just died, and though he was still in school, he didn’t really like to go home any more, even though he had siblings. So my Aunts made him a cot in the Dining Room of their house, and he was sleeping there, and eating his meals there, and finishing high school in Pineville’s senior high school. I thought he was a real cute boy. I liked him, and we got along o.k. together. I saw him only rarely, when we happened to meet at my Grandmother’s house. He even asked me for a date—though I was very young—and we went to a movie together. It was the only time we had a date. Sometimes on Sundays he would go for a walk with me, and most usually we were certainly not alone.</p><p>I saw him often with his arm around my Aunt Martha’s shoulder, and I thought that he was just lonely for his mother, and needed a hug. As time went on, Allen graduated from high school and went to work at a carbon plant. He still slept in the dining room at my Grandparent’s house, and apparently ate all his meals with the family. He was still in High School, and drove a school bus. He ate meals with the family so often I wondered if he ever went home, especially after his mother succumbed to her illness. </p><p>When summer came around that year, my mother agreed to go to the beach with Aunt Martha and Allen. My Mother went as a chaperone, because Grandmother Yandle and the others in the house were a little alarmed at the closeness that was building up between my aunt and the very young boy. I was a little bit miffed that I wasn’t invited to go with them. I thought of Allen, traveling with two old ladies, and wondering if he would even have a chance to enjoy the trip. I thought that particular trio was sort of odd group to visit the beach. However, Mother asked me to stay in Charlotte, and run the little paint store that was across the street from our house. My Dad rented the space and Mother served as the salesperson. She answered Daddy’s business telephone, and typed his reports and when folks in our neighborhood needed a bucket of paint, she sold it to them. There weren’t many customers, but the fact that it was an open and active business made it possible for my Dad to buy his paint at wholesale prices, and that was enough of an edge to make the rent of the store worth while. If we sold three cans of paint a day it was a big day. Because we lived only across the street from the store there were often folks knocking on our door in the evening, wanting to buy a small can of paint, and if we were at home, some one of us walked across the street to accommodate the neighbor.</p><p>We didn’t have many customers, but I, who had spent many afternoons in the store and learned a lot about what customers usually wanted, and could easily help them decide what they needed. I could type if Daddy needed a letter, or a proposal for a job, and most of our shoppers sort of did a double-take when they saw me, because my mother and I were much alike, except for our ages. Mother had long hair she wore in a bun at the nape of her neck. That summer, I also had long hair which I wore in a bun at the nape of my neck. I didn’t run into any problems that I couldn’t solve, and Mother’s absence didn’t cause Daddy or me any problems. </p><p>When the few days of the beach trip were over, Allen and Aunt Martha made an announcement. They had stopped in South Carolina on their way to the beach, and had been legally married to each other. Aunt Martha was Mrs. Estridge. The newly weds did not rush away from the Yandle house where they had been living, but eventually they had a home, and Aunt Martha left the house she had lived in all her life, and left Aunt Helen and Uncle Eddie to run the house, as before. Aunt Martha was very good about visiting her parents, and helped her sister and brother a great deal.</p><p>As the years rolled by, Grandfather Yandle went home to be with the Lord, and Grandmother Yandle lived several more years, and she, too, went home to be with the Lord. </p><p>When only Aunt Helen and Uncle Eddie were left in the old home place, they were aging, and unable to actually farm the land, nor manage the animals. The animals were sold, the house was sold, and Aunt Helen and Uncle Eddie moved into a house not far from Aunt Pauline’s home. They had electricity, and indoor toilets, central heating in winter, and few chores beyond washing dishes. Uncle Eddie had smoked for most of his life, and he developed emphysema and was not able to work. Aunt Helen kept house, and looked after Uncle Eddie. Aunt Pauline looked after both of them, advising them, and helping them get groceries as neither of them could drive a car. When Uncle Eddie succumbed to emphysema Aunt Pauline, whose husband had died, asked Aunt Helen to come live with her. And so the sisters shared a home until Aunt Helen began to suffer from Alzheimer’s, and then Aunt Pauline helped her with placement in the Methodist Home, as Aunt Pauline was herself quite frail, and no longer able to look after Aunt Helen. Shortly after Aunt Helen was placed in the Methodist Home, Aunt Pauline moved to an assisted living home, and lived there until her death. </p><p>. </p><p>They had no children, however, Uncle Henry had nieces—two of them who were sisters, and who wanted to work in Charlotte. The two girls lived with Aunt Pauline and Uncle Henry for several years, attending school, and working in Charlotte. Aunt Pauline became a sort of extra mother for them, guiding them, teaching them. They were beautiful girls, and good girls as well. She helped them with schooling, and she advised them as to jobs when they had finished school. It was Aunt Pauline who planned their weddings when they decided to marry. They had beautiful weddings. Both girls treated her as if she were their mother. </p><p>When I was about ten or twelve years old, I spent one entire summer unable to go out of my house beyond my own yard, and I was forbidden to have the company of neighboring children or friends. That was the year that Infantile Paralysis was causing illnesses to both adults and children in North Carolina. There were no curatives that could be used to fight that terrible sickness. Another name for it is Poliomyelitis. It was also called Infantile Paralysis because it struck more children than adults. The illness began not far from Charlotte in the mountains of North Carolina. The City of Charlotte proclaimed that children could not attend any presentation that drew a crowd—school, church, movies, parks, play grounds, and any other place where children would come into contact with other children. School ended early that year, and ordinarily school would have resumed ordinarily in early September; however, school was delayed until cooler weather arrived. It was believed that hot weather played some part in the spreading of poliomyelitis, the medical name for the epidemic. My mother and Dad called it infantile paralysis. I couldn’t play with the neighbor children, nor go to Sunday School, nor to the movies, and I couldn’t even go to the Public Library to select books to read. I was by that time wearing braces to straighten my teeth, and I walked to my orthodontic appointments and then walked as quickly as possible back home. Children didn’t go to church, nor to movies, nor did they meet in groups within neighborhoods to play. Instead, children stayed home, and away from other children. In Charlotte there were public parks, and to look after them there was an office for the Department of Recreation—where a designated person was in charge of all the Charlotte Parks and areas of Recreation. That summer they had a thirty minute radio program every week day to suggest ways that children use their time since they could not play with neighbors. The Parks and Recreation Department of the City of Charlotte started a radio show every day with ideas for solitary games, or games siblings could play together. However, most parents did not allow their children to get close enough to other children to actually play with them. It was a lonely summer vacation, and boring. As well as I remember, I was about thirteen at that time. I went up town that summer only twice, and that was to visit my orthodontist. I was wearing braces to rearrange my teeth because my jaw wasn’t large enough to accommodate all the teeth that God gave me. For all the teasing I got for having a big mouth, it wasn’t big enough for all my teeth to sit side by side in comfort. So I had eye-teeth growing out under my nose, and other teeth over-lapped each other. Therefore, I did have the privilege of walking to my dental appointments throughout that summer. </p><p>Children were not allowed to wander around on the streets, and they couldn’t visit even next door. They couldn’t play jump rope together, or any type of ball game. Nor could little girls gather to play with their dolls. This was before television, but people did have radios. Kids could listen to radio, read books, though they couldn’t go to the library themselves. They couldn’t skate on the streets, nor congregate in a park. They were encouraged not to play with neighbors. Youths over sixteen could attend movies and take summer jobs, but younger children were required to stay at home, playing with brothers and sisters, but not with neighbors. I was isolated in my home, and since I had no siblings except my older sister, I spent that summer alone, listening to the radio and reading books from the library that my sister picked out for me. I did take over a lot of the housekeeping chores, and tried my hand at fixing supper every day for my family. Luckily I could call my mother if I didn’t know how to cook a dish. </p><p>Children in North Carolina and elsewhere were crippled by the illness. Sadly, many children contracted the disease and were paralyzed for the rest of their lives. It struck mostly children, but adults were also vulnerable. I could not attend movies. I could not go to church. I could not visit my friends in the neighborhood, nor could they come to play with me. I could not go to the Library to choose my own books to read. I could not run to the café on the corner to get a Popsicle or a chilled soft drink. Poliomyelitis was a crippling disease, and sometimes interfered with the ability to breathe, so that the iron lung, a breathing machine, was invented to help those people to live. It was no respecter of persons. Franklin Delano Roosevelt had suffered from this illness as a young man, but though he was restricted to a wheel chair he was elected President. Antibiotics as we know them today had not yet been discovered. There were no medicines that seemed to help the victims of the illness. </p><p>As the summer came to a close and the number of Poliomyelitis declined, schools were eventually opened and life began to go on again. At that time there were no antibiotics that would fight that illness, or any other serious illness. </p><p>Epidemic in North Carolin. Schools closed early, and didn’t open on time that year. There were no antibiotics to fight that illness, and those persons both old and young were paralysed. Not only could they not walk, they sometimes couldn’t use their arms, or even breathe without a machine to push air into their lungs. It was a devastating and terrible illness, and it struck children more often than adults—but adults could become victims of the disease also, though they were not as likely to catch it as children. It was a terrible epidemic, and many children in North Carolina were victims. It was in some situations the children died, in others they lost the use of their legs, and in other situations they were paralyzed all over, couldn’t move, and couldn’t even breathe without an iron lung, a contraption that forced oxygen into their lungs. This was the same illness that struck Franklin D. Roosevelt and left him unable to walk. Children died, or were paralyzed for the rest of their lives, and of course, adults were also vulnerable. Schools were closed early, and opened late, as the powers that be thought that the heat of summer, and the conditions under a hot sun had something to do with it. North Carolina had an epidemic. Parents were advised to keep their children away from their playmates, and certainly keep them out of crowds. Therefore, there were no movies for the kids, nor were gatherings such as Birthday Parties, or skating rinks, or swimming pools. I couldn’t even go to the library. My sister had to bring to me any books that I read that summer. She was old enough to be able to go into movie theatres, but I couldn’t go, and she obliged me by telling me the stories of the movies she was able to see. I could listen to the radio, and I could color in color books, and read library books. But I could not “go out to play” with other children. </p><p>gatherings of any kind that children were allowed to visit. School closed early, and children could not wander around their neighborhoods, or even go to church. </p><p>em were married, except my Dad. Then one day I was advised that Aunt Pauline, My Dad’s youngest sister, did get married. After she married she moved out of her parent’s house, and rented a house only a short walking distance away from the house she grew up in. Her house had a telephone, a radio, electricity, and running water. She also had a refrigerator, and an indoor bath room. It had a kitchen, a living room, a bed room, and an extra room. There was even a driveway beside it. I thought that was very nice—especially the radio. about worked outside the home. My Aunt Helen, for as long as I could remember, had been the cook in that house. She took care of the kitchen, but Aunt Martha helped her. Aunt Helen fed her chickens, her cats, and her dog. Uncle Eddie milked the cow and fed the pigs, and took corn kernels off the cobs so the chickens would grow fat enough to eat, or would lay lots of eggs. Since I was mostly at their house on Sundays, I never saw who took care of the garden where vegetables were grown, nor did I realize who planted or picked the cotton, or harvested the grain. My uncle seemed to be a fragile person, who probably weighed less than any of his sisters. Yet there was always corn in the corn crib, and tools in the tool shed, and the cows got milked, and fed, and so did the chickens and pigs. I was the cotton fields growing, and sometimes the corn field. I saw the water-melon patch. But it was always Sunday when I visited, and I didn’t see Uncle Eddie plowing the fields or reaping his crops. There was a well house, and a well in the back yard, with a pulley with a chain that hung over a wooden box, and if you turned a crank, you could pull up a fresh pail of water. The well house had a cement floor, and was shaded by a couple of trees. It was always cool inside it, and I never found out why, or how they did it, because they didn’t have any ice inside the well house. Despite the lack of electricity that small building was always cooler inside than it was outside. And it was always much, much, cooler than the kitchen, or even my grandmother’s sitting room, which was her bedroom, too. </p><p>When Grandmother, who was a tiny little woman, got out of her bed, she would walk about six steps to her rocking chair that had a cushion on the seat and there was also a pad on the back of the chair to make a soft pillow for her back. Grandmother could sit there, next to a window, and she could gently rock her chair, making no sound, and enjoy being out of bed. Often she had company on Sundays, and lots of people came to see her. 88888888888888888888888888888 on her backher cushioned rocking chair. Otherwise the room had a stove, a dresser with four drawers, and a big rocking chair for my Grandfather, and a couple of straight chairs that were just like the cane bottomed chairs that sat under the kitchen table. I still have two of those chairs, because when the house was sold my Dad took the old cane bottom chairs since Aunt Helen didn’t want them. </p><p>.than the yard outside. I didn’t even know who canned the fruit and vegetables to preserve them for the winter. But . . I didn’t know who cut and stacked the hay. There was always a cow or two, and Uncle Eddie was the one who milked the cow, but it was Aunt Helen who strained the milk and put it in a large jar. Then it was Uncle Eddie or Aunt Martha who took it to the well house to preserve it. In that house there was no ice box, and no refrigerator. My Yandle grandparents did not have electricity until I was nearly seventeen. They used kerosene lamps that were lit when it was near dark. but they were never lit until it was almost dark. </p><p>I don’t know where my Great-grandparents lived. My Dad never mentioned it. They may all have lived in the house where my Grandfather and Grandmother lived, but it , . There is now no one to ask about how those early families lived, and exactly where they lived. I heard stories, of course, that made me think that three generations might have lived together, but I don’t know where. When I sat in my Grandmother’s room and listened to people talk and reminisce I heard lots of stories. There were cousins who had known each other very well, played together, and worked together; however, they were no longer doing so. When I was a child we visited my Dad’s parents almost every Sunday, and often people came to see them to whom I was introduced, and the grownups talked to each other as if they knew each other really well. Most of those folks were cousins and most of them were my Dad’s age or older—but I was very young during that time, and people I saw perhaps only once or perhaps twice in my life didn’t stick forever after in my memory. I do remember that upon entering the house where my Grandparents lived I would often find visitors already in her room—visitors that were old, at least in my childish sight, and through the long afternoons I sat in my Grandmother Yandle’s room carefully listening as the adults rambled about things that had happened long ago, or sharing information about people whom all of them knew who were sick, or going on a trip, or being married, or sometimes having a new baby. I knew changes happened, and I also learned that they knew a lot of people I had never seen, and that they all actually enjoyed their chatter about people I didn’t even know. Sometimes they would mention old friends who were sick, or someone who had indicated that they were coming for a visit, or people whose children were marrying, or having babies, or needed to find jobs. I wished that I could listen to the radio, instead of trying to figure who, or what they were talking about. </p><p>I do remember that when electric power became available in that area, my Dad had electricity attached to their house, and from then on they had electric lights in every room. They finally did have a nice radio, but I could never listen to it because it sat in Grandmother’s room. When lots of people had come to talk to Grandmother, they did precisely that. They talked. Since there was only one radio and it was in Grandmother’s room, I missed an awful lot of Gene Autry programs every Sunday evening because the grownups preferred to talk. </p><p>Eventually, when I was well up in my teen years, My Dad’s family had a telephone installed in my Grandmother’s house. I don’t ever remember calling them on the phone, nor do I remember ever having a call from that house. As I remember, Pineville’s telephone lines once belonged to a private company, making calls to Pineville from Charlotte “long distance” and therefore expensive. Eventually Southern Bell bought that small company, and included it in the Charlotte area. Until that time Pineville family members rarely telephoned us, nor did we randomly chat with then. After Southern Bell bought the Pineville system, ordinary conversation between us was easier.<br/> When we visited the Yandle house in Pineville, I do remember, from a very early age, that my Mother often encouraged me to remember that I had seen a person, especially if the person was old. Usually that person had not meant much to me—their being old and just sitting in the room with my Grandmother, and just talking, and laughing, about things that happened when they were children. But now I wish I had been wise enough to capture it all in my mind, with clear understanding of who was involved in the many episodes they talked about, and where that particular action occurred. For instance there was a story my Dad told of a neighbor who didn’t like young boys to get too close to his house or his animals, but did have a very tempting recreational object close to his house. He had a large grapevine dangling from a tall tree, enticingly near a creek. He didn’t like boys to come onto his property, and lots of little boys, including my Dad and his friends, liked to swing on that vine and wade in that creek quite near to his house. It was long years before movies and Tarzan stories were shown on the big screen, but children didn’t need to watch movie stories about jungles to realize what fun it would be to swing over the creek on that vine, and jump into the cooling water. Once I heard the story, I wished I knew where that place was so I could swing on it too. But the old gentleman who lived in that house would chase the boys away, and then tell their parents so that they would be punished. Then one day the boys—probably all cousins—wandered by that old man’s house and discovered that he was not at home. So they had a swinging, splashing, good time until the owner returned home, and promptly tattled on them to their parents. </p><p>The elderly gentleman lived alone, and apparently liked it that way. However, there was another day when the old man didn’t seem to be at home. The boys came into his yard, and upon finding that he was away, and then the boys decided to “get even” for his meanness. They felt justified, as they were not just “little” kids, and they weren’t hurting anything by swinging on the vine. They only wanted to play on this wonderful vine. On other occasions they had all been frightened by the old fellow’s anger. Because they saw no harm in their vine swinging, they resented the old man’s objection to their play. One day they tried again, and their reconnaissance showed that, indeed, the old gentleman was not at home. The boys talked it over, and planned revenge. That day there were three of them. They each tied strings around both their ankles making the legs of their overalls a sort of bag—and they filled the legs of their overalls with dry sand from the creek bank until it was difficult for them to walk. Then they went through the unlocked door of that old man’s house, and loosed the strings, so that as they moved around the floor within the house they sifted sand onto his floor. All over his house the floor was covered with sand. The boys didn’t take anything, nor break anything. Even so, the old man could figure out who left him such a message. Unfortunately the boys, at least three of them, were immediately suspected as the culprits, so they didn’t get away with it, and the boys got a whipping. However, they didn’t feel ashamed, either, and when my Dad told that story, he laughed, as if their revenge was still sort of satisfactory to him because the old man had run them off when they were having innocent fun swinging over the creek on his grapevine. </p><p>Among the stories my mother told were a few that were almost heart-breaking. Mother had a little brother, and when he began to walk she played with him. He became ill, and though his family and the Pineville Doctor did everything they could to help him, he died. My Mother had loved him, and all through her growing years, and after she was married, she kept a small china boy figurine because it had been her little brother’s toy. Today, I have that small china figurine in a cabinet with other keepsakes, and remember a sister’s love for her younger brother, and also I think of the fragility of life, and say a prayer of thanksgiving that today there are medicines, and antibiotics, and trained doctors with great knowledge. That we do not live in a perfect world cannot be disputed, but I am increasingly thankful for the medical profession and their skills that save lives, and help people to stay well and enjoy life and the living of it. </p><p>There was a family near the farm of my maternal Grandparents, and when my mother was still only a girl child, she felt sorry for children who had no clothes. One family in particular caught at her heart—for there was a child she particularly pitted because he was always naked. He had no clothes. Mother was probably about eleven or twelve years old. She made clothes for that child, and gave them to him. I don’t know what kind of cloth she used, and she didn’t name the child. However she had cut out the garment and sewed it by hand, and given the clothing to the child. At intervals for some time afterwards she made him clothes to wear. </p><p>My mother was the youngest child in her family, with two older brothers and an older sister. When she, herself, had been very young, there had been a younger child, a little brother, who lived to be about three years old. The boy child suffered an illness that took his life. She told me about him when I was a child, and pointed out that in a drawer of her dresser there was a small china figure of a little boy in blue pants with a brown cap on his head. The little figure had been the toy of Mother’s little brother, and she had kept it all of those years as a precious remembrance. When I married she gave the little boy figurine to me, and I have it yet, and cherish it. My Mother had treasured that remembrance of her little brother, and so I treasured it, too. I thought about that very young child who died so very young. It was a reminder to me at an early age that no one is guaranteed a long life. Life, my Dad once said, is never guaranteed. Always, he told me, live it fully every day—we are not promised another day. </p><p>Because I was six years younger than my sister we didn’t play together. There were few children my age in our neighborhood, though my sister had always seemed to have lots of playmates. There never seemed to be any who were my age to play with. When I was about three years old there was suddenly a little girl for me to play with, and not only was she my age, she had the same name as me. I had a friend, a neighbor, at last. When we heard a grownup call “Jean” we didn’t know which of us was being called, so our families called us by both first and last names. I hadn’t known before that people could have the same names. It was a novelty, and didn’t disturb either of us. We both enjoyed playing together, and did so every day. Both of us became used to the idea that she was Jean Orr (full name), and I was Jean Yandle (full name) and neither of us saw anything odd about it. I don’t think Jean Orr had anyone else to play with, and my sister had always had two words in her name—she was called Ella Cornelia. I suppose I thought all children had long names. </p><p>Our tight friendship endured for a couple of years, then one day she didn’t come out to play, and her Aunt Ponnie told me she had “gone away.” I was very sad. We had both been without other playmates, and we were not only best friends, we were only friends for each other. She had not told me goodbye, or even told me she was going. I asked my mother where she went. My mother said she was sick and when she was well she could come home. But she didn’t come home until both of us had reached twelve or thirteen. So far as I could understand, she just went away, and she didn’t live with her Aunt Ponnie any more. I was very lonely for a while, but life went on. </p><p>I explained that we lived in a duplex, and that between our side of the house, and the people who lived in the other half of our house, there was a single wall. When I lived next door to us</p><p>We both grew up, of course, and one day someone told me that Jean Orr was living with her Mother only about half a mile away from me. The apartment her mother rented was about a mile away from my house, and to get there I had to walk alone. Her Mother was never at home when I visited her. We usually had a fine time together, but on one visit we, as children do upon a occasions, disagreed. I was quite upset about the disagreement, and went home. When I next wanted to visit her, she and her mother had moved. After her address changed I lost touch with her. I was living in the same house I had lived in almost all of my life, and the back yard of her Aunt Ponnie still adjoined the back yard of my parents, however Jean and I did not meet again for years. Some years later and after my marriage and the birth of our first child, I went shopping in the Sears Roebuck store. I paused for a moment to look at merchandise, a small blond haired clerk spoke to me. She asked me if I was Jean Yandle. I, she said, am Jean Orr. Both of us were married and both had children. The bond that had held us together as very small children made the meeting a lovely moment, but after all the years we had been separated, we had little in common as adults, and were never again as close as we had been as small children. </p><p>The reason Jean had been taken away from her Aunt was, to my way of thinking, a terrible and frightening situation. She was not only a very young child, she was a very small little person. How it came about, I never knew, but she was examined by a physician who took an X-ray of her chest, and found a lung anomaly. In those days—the 1930’s—there were no antibiotics at all. In the United States there had been—and still was—a deadly disease that spread easily among family members and among any, and sometimes all, the people with whom the sick person came into contact. The name of the illness was tuberculosis, and was generally called simply TB. People who had the disease could spread it with a cough and most people who contracted the disease never got well, and most of the time any body who spent much time around them also contracted the fatal disease. There were no medicines that could curb it, and not much hope that those afflicted would ever recover. There was always a chance that people they had been in close contact with would also be infected with the disease. Eventually the government required people who contracted TB had to be quarantined in a facility that was like a hospital. However, almost all of the patients had the same disease. They were compelled to stay there until they were either cured, or they died. </p><p>Because a chest x-ray showed “something” in her lungs, the powers that be sent her to a tuberculosis hospital, though she didn’t actually have tuberculosis. She was not released for a number of years, and she never did have tuberculosis. She was at least twelve years old when she was allowed to return to Charlotte. She had attended school classes in the TB Sanitorium. But she had been in a sort of hospital for all those years, away from her family. I couldn’t even imagine how lonely and how different that would be. She told me a little bit about her life in that place. I felt terribly sad about what I heard; that anyone could be taken from their home, and could be kept in a sort of prison—at least they couldn’t leave even if they wanted to leave. She had been no more than about four years old when she was placed in that hospital. </p><p>Of course there were no antibiotics in those days to “cure” any illness. TB was catching. It was extremely easy to spread that terrible illness form person to person. People died from it. I had never before heard of anyone who had TB that had lived very long after they contracted it. I am not sure when Jean was released. She did not have the disease, she had never had the disease, but she had spent a large part of her childhood cooped up in a hospital with sick people whose illness was of the sort that ended in death more often than in healing. She began to live in the world again when we were about twelve years old. I learned later that she had married, and had a lovely family. We had been very close friends so long ago, long before we were of school age. It was some years before I found another friend with whom I could share so much of my life. </p><p>My sister had always seemed to have had five or six “friends” to play with any time she went out of the door. When I was old enough to interact with other children there were none exactly my age. Marian Kanasas, the sister of little Pete, the child who broke the three-center bottle that cut my wrist, was just enough older than me that, for her, interacting with me was to be friends with someone much younger than herself, therefore making her reduce her games and pastimes to my level, since it was probably impossible for me to climb past my own age into her level of maturity. The only children Marian’s age were male, and for me, it was just as it was for Marian—we had no neighborhood friends to with whom we could play. </p><p>little boy who broke the bottle that cut my hand When I was five years old I was alert enough quite early in my life to realize that city life differed from the way my grandparents lived just twelve miles away from my house. They didn’t have electric power, or water spigots in their houses, and they didn’t have indoor bathrooms. My Aunt Ola didn’t have a telephone for years after I was married. Their lives didn’t seem to be harmed by these lacks, nor did our lives seem to be terribly enriched by our position. </p><p>City blocks in the 1930’s in Charlotte, especially in neighborhoods that had been measured into square blocks with carefully measured streets along which electricity marched enclosed in tightly wrapped electric lines that hung on tall poles that also held telephone lines. that that were all about the same size, however different or however much alike they were. Most of the housing where I grew up was fairly neat, and furnished with running water and sewage pipes, with nominal electricity, and in some cases natural gas lines for stoves and hot . We lived with “modern” type fixtures the architecture were neatly were nice and square, and the houses were fairly close to each other. were two families who lived “next” to our house, if you can count the fact that their back doors opened onto a narrow yard next to a driveway beside my house. I felt well blessed to have one child close to my age as my play mate. However, our relationship was </p><p>She even had the same name as me. Then she went away. There I was on a street where there were two little girls just a little younger than me, and another girl who was about three or four years older than me. There weren’t any other kids on the block. The kids closest to my age had almost nothing in common with me. I was older, and had to teach them how to play. They had not learned to “imagine” things. Therefore, I was always the one to make the plans, and lay out the games. They seldom ever disputed me. I had skates, but they didn’t. I had a swing on my porch—but you can be happy swinging only so long. After a while it becomes sort of boring. There were no see-saws, no nice sand piles, no lovely shade trees under which to play dolls, and they didn’t have any nice dolls, anyway. Those years were the late 1930’s and the early 1940’s. Remember that there was no television, and precious little radio that appealed to children. None of us had swings or see-saws in our yard. None of us had either tricycle or bicycle. Then when I was about ten years old I had skates, and they were wonderful—but my younger friends didn’t have skates so I had to skate alone.<br/> 88888888888888888888888 Don’t think that times were the same then as now. They weren’t. We were certainly not the only kids in the country who didn’t have a swing in our back yard. The Depression had happened before I was born. I never was hungry, nor did I ever lack good clothes or shoes. I had occasional treats like ice cream on a stick, or a little paper cup full of ice cream, and we lived in a comfortable house. There was a café on the corner of Graham and Eleventh streets, just down the block on which we lived. It was run by a neighbor who was born in Greece, named Mr. Kanasas. He spoke English, with an accent. Greek man sold an interesting drink called “Three Center” which was a poor man’s Coke, as a Coca Cola cost five cents for six ounces, and Three Center had a deceptive bottle that looked as big as a Coke bottle, but was really just thicker, and held about four ounces, and cost three cents. </p><p>Sometimes even a nickel was a lot of money tled drink, probably a that came in a thick glass bottle called the “Three Center,” which cost exactly three pennies. It tasted a little bit like a cola. It was sold at the café on the corner of our street. The man who ran the café was born in Greece, though he spoke English with a Greek accent. Dave Kanasas lived on Pine Street with his wife and three children. Their back yard was parallel to our back yard, and my Dad rented a double garage on their property in which to park his truck, and he could use the driveway beside our house to enter the garage. </p><p>The Kanasas family had three children, an older boy close to my sister’s age, a girl just a little older that me, but younger than my sister, and a younger boy several months younger than me. The youngest boy was named Pete. Marian sometimes played with me, but not often, as she was several years older than me. I noticed that she seldom played with her little brother, Pete. I didn’t like to play with him either. I was well aware that Pete was sometimes quite mean. I have a scar to prove it. </p><p>I was not quite six years old the day Pete invited me to play with him in his yard. He felt lonely, as I did, because there were no other children exactly our ages to play together. The bottom of our back yard touched the side of Pete’s back yard, and his Daddy had a double garage at the bottom of his yard which my Dad rented. My Dad’s business truck—he was a painting contractor—was loaded with valuable drop-cloths, brushes, paint cans, ladders, and other important stuff, and Daddy needed a garage to keep people from steeling from his truck during t 8888888888888888888888888888888888 he night. The Kanasas family had no car, but they had a two car garage, so my Dad rented their garage space. Our back yards touched each other, and my Dad rented the garages at the bottom of the Pete’s back yard . Pete’s house to park his car and his painter’s truck. One spring day Pete invited me to come over to play with him. He had taken one of my Dad’s empty five gallon paint buckets that had been left near the garage, and Pete was using it to play with. He turned it upside down, and then topped the bucket with a wide board that had once been the top of his sister’s play-table. One of the most wonderful toys a child could have was a pretend tea table. Of course children could use it for a writing table or desk—and the tables were usually sold with at least two small chairs for children to sit in. The table top Pete was playing with had no legs. He carefully laid it across the five gallon paint bucket, and invited me to sit with him. I remember that at first I refused, accusing him of trying to trick me so he could make me fall to the ground. He earnestly begged me to join him—him on one end, me on the other, so both of us could sit and talk. He promised to warn me before he jumped off the table. I fell for his plea after he promised, and I sat with him for a short period of time and we talked. Suddenly, Pete jumped off the unbalanced table top, causing me to slide off the other end. My fall would have been aggravating but not really important had there not been another “toy” that Pete had invented just behind our paint can and table top. Several bricks lay on the ground in the same vicinity, and close to them was a discarded soda bottle. Those were the days when the entire United States was still reeling from the Depression. Many people could neither buy groceries nor pay their rent. Six ounce Coca Cola was for sale by the bottle for five cents. But there was also a “look-alike” carbonated drink called a Three-Center—meaning that it cost three cents, and the bottle held less than six ounces and didn’t taste as good as real Coca Cola. Pete’s Dad sold Three Centers. tasty than a Coke, . It was not as tasty as Coca Cola, and there were fewer ounces in its thick glass bottle </p><p>not even buy groceries no three-center bottle lay. A small amount of a Coca Cola-type drink was sold for three cents, and was bottled in a similar shaped bottle that was so thick the contents looked much the same, but there were less than six ounces in the Three-Center bottle that held the drink was about the size of a six ounce Coca Cola. The bottle was very thick to make the drink inside appear to be as large as a Coca Cola. twice as thick as the Cola bo worth of a There were several bricks lying on the ground. There was also a Three-Center bottle near by. The Three-Center bottle was like many of the earliest bottles holding colas and beers—they were thick, so that they would look like a very generous cola type drink, but were actually a much smaller amount. It cost only three cents—and that is why it was called a “Three Center”. Just before we both sat on the table top on top of the bucket, Pete had used a brick to whack at a three-center bottle, and had broken it into several thick pieces of glass. Then he sat with me on the table top and we talked a little, and he suddenly, without warning, hopped off and I slid off the tilted table top onto the glass bottle, with one hand thrown out beside me to break my fall. It did, but the patch of ground under my hand was the place where the Three Center bottle had been broken. When I got up, blood was flowing quickly from my left wrist, across my palm, through my fingers, and down onto the ground. It was not a tiny skinned place that shed a few drops—it was a artery through which my fearful heart was pumping blood with terrifying speed. It was pouring off my hand onto the ground, and splashing on my dress. I screamed—and my mother heard me. She rushed into the yard, picked me up and hurried me into the house. She caught up my sister’s clean pajamas to catch the blood, put a rubber band around my wrist as a tourniquet. Somehow she called the doctor who had saved my sister’s life when she was sick, and—believe it or not—he came in his own automobile to get me when he heard that I was bleeding so copiously and my mother had no way to take me to him—therefore he honked, mother carried me out to his car, and he drove less than a mile back to his office. He carried me in, and sewed up my wrist. I remember wearing a bandage, and I remember having to visit the doctor again to have the stitches removed. It has been more than seventy years since then, and I remember every one of those stitches to this day. I also have a puffed scar that has puzzled physicians I have visited, and caused people I went to work for to ask if I had tried to commit suicide. I still have the scar, and I guess people still wonder how I got it. But it was every bit Pete’s fault. And I never trusted him anymore. I was never ugly to him, and I often visited his older sister, but I didn’t play with Pete again for years, and not very often, then. I did wonder if he actually didn’t remember what happened that day, or didn’t think his actions caused me to cut my wrist. I wondered if he ever told his mother what happened. I don’t ever remember actually trusting him ever again, though he did join me and another boy who was about my age with a few games of cowboy and Indian, but I remained wary of Pete. One of our neighbors had a grandson about my age that I played cowboys with, and Pete joined our game once in a while. The three of us had fun together, but I never placed myself in our cowboy game so that Pete could hurt me, or cause me to get hurt. There was an old motto: Once bitten, twice shy. </p><p>My full name was Iris Jean, but for years Mother and Daddy usually called me only “Jean”. I thought that a bit strange, since she almost always called my sister Ella Cornelia—the entire name, while I was not called Iris Jean, but just Jean. I never asked the question when I was small, but one day when I was a teenager I asked my Mother why my sister was always called her full name, when I was called simply Jean. She told me that she and Daddy had decided that since my sister was named after both her grandmothers they could not honor one grandmother above the other, so they always called her by both names. I understood that my parents could not “drop” one name making the other Grandmother feel left out. I was probably about eight years old when I asked about why my name had only one syllable and my sister’s had at least five. If I was called Iris Jean, my full name, I would have at least three syllables in my name. I was told that it was easier to call me Jean, and it wouldn’t do to call her by only one of her two names as that would be honoring one Grandparent more than the other. Of course I understood. It was perfectly clear. My sister was worth the extra breath to say her full name. I wasn’t worth the effort, so I remained just plain Jean. Strangely, it didn’t make me bitter, nor did it cause me to dislike my sister. However, I was acutely aware that my sister, and her wants, were more important to my parents than my wants. I realized that If we both needed shoes, she would get hers first. If Mother was making both of us dresses, hers would be finished first. When my sister wanted something—anything—she was quite likely to get it. If I asked for something, it was suggested that I do some extra chores to “earn” whatever it was. Despite the discrepancy, I was never without clothing, or shoes, or any thing else. I was never hungry, nor left out if treats were being served. I felt loved—but I always knew that my sister got first choice, and most of the time was she was first in line when both of us could expect a new dress, or anything else. </p><p>There was a day when I had another lesson about who was important in our family. When I was old enough to notice the difference in our names, I suggested to my mother that since my sister was called by her entire name that I, also, should be called Iris Jean—not just Jean, a one syllable word. My Mother explained about the two grandmothers, one of whom would be unhappy if her name was dropped from the double name—the honor was for both of them. Her name could not be shortened. I, of course, understood perfectly. They loved her much more than they loved me. I was, somehow, inferior to my sister. I accepted it, and did what I had heard brave people say: Grin and bear it! </p><p>It was very simple. They liked my sister better than me. My sister was already in high school, doing things that were, in my estimation, like “grown-up” things. I wasn’t stupid, and I did have a memory. Easter was quite near, and both of us usually had new shoes just before Easter. I had been saving dimes to pay for my Easter shoes. Our Uncle Eddie, our Dad’s brother, gave me a dime every Sunday, and I had filled a $5.00 dime bank that Mother said could be spent on Easter Shoes. I felt proud that I could help pay for Easter shoes. One day we went shopping. Mother took both me and my sister to Belks Department Store to get new shoes. She bought Ella Cornelia’s shoes in the large shoe department, and I saw her hand my dime bank to the lady to pay for my sister’s shoes. Ella Cornelia now had her Easter shoes. I didn’t mind her having her shoes. I took my shoes off so that I could try on my shoes. My Mother told me we were going to a different store to buy my shoes, so I put my shoes back on, and we went to “Little Belks” which was where they sold items that didn’t sell at regular prices in the “Big” store. My mother picked out some cheap white sandals for me, and those were my Easter shoes. I remember that I didn’t cry. I remember that I resented the fact that my dimes were used on my sister, and I was supposed to be happy with cheap sandals. That was undeniable proof that I was not as lovable as my sister. I didn’t matter very much to anybody—but my sister deserved the best, even if it was my money, and I could always make do with cheap stuff. I said nothing, and I did not cry. I did wonder why I was not as lovable, nor as important as my sister. </p><p>. When I was very young my aunts would call me Iris Jean—two names. But that wore off early, and by the time I was five or six everybody called me simply “Jean.” Sometimes my mother even called me “Jimmy.” One day I asked her why. My mother said it was because, had I been a boy my name would have been James. It made me sad to think that I my Mother was sorry that I had not been the boy child she wanted. And I tried hard to be strong—stronger than most girls, and able to do things that, had I been a boy, I could have done with ease. I also tried for most of my childhood to lift the heavy chores onto my shoulders if possible. My sister was often treated as if she was especially fragile. She looked quite healthy, and could boss me around with vigor. However she was subject to short illnesses at times, and my Mother was careful that she did not every overdo any activity she chose to pursue. Mother treated her as </p><p>Therefore, I deliberately took on the heavy chores. I carried the coal for the stove into the house, and took out the ashes. I killed the chickens that would be our Sunday dinner. I split the kindling for the fires, and I carried the groceries home from the store. I looked after any pets we had, and mopped the kitchen when it needed it. I did not want to disappoint my mother if she needed someone strong. We were, both of us, satisfied that God didn’t make mistakes, and we were sort of stuck with the fact that I was female. However, while my sister was a girly sort of girl, I was always a tomboy, and half of my playmates after my seventh birthday were male. We played cowboys. And we had “horses” to ride. Since my Dad was a painting contractor, he sometimes had access to barrels. I don’t remember where he got them, but he had two that were in constant use, and a couple more that just sat in the back yard. With a brick on both sides of a barrel to hold it steady as it lay on lengthwise, we had “horses” so we could ride to the rescue of each other. I rode a million miles on my oil drum. Of course, I enjoyed every minute of my many rides. My playmates were mostly Pete Kanasas whose backyard touched our back yard, and an older boy named Bobby who lived across the street from Pete’s house. We three rode countless miles across empty praeries upon our barrel horses, fought bad guys together, and rescued many an Indian who would forever be our friend, and when there was a real race to do good for someone, I was always in front. If we split our trio into both good and bad guys, I usually insisted that I be the “good” guy, and only once in a while did I agree to be the “bad” guy. As the “good” guy I always came in the nick of time to save them from the imaginary bad guys. However, I generously allowed them to “save” me once in a while. </p><p>Because I was six years younger than my sister, and there were few children my age in our neighborhood, I had few playmates. My sister had always seemed to have had five or six “friends” to play with. When I was old enough to interact with other children I felt well blessed to have a child close to my age as my play mate. My full name was Iris Jean, but Mother and Daddy usually called me only “Jean”. Strangely, I thought, since she almost always called my sister Ella Cornelia—the entire name—though I was mostly called simply Jean. My aunts would call me Iris Jean—two names. Sometimes my mother even called me “Jimmy.” One day I asked her why. My mother said it was because, had I been a boy my name would have been James. It made me sad to think that I my Mother was sorry that I had not been the boy child she wanted. And I tried hard to be strong—stronger than most girls, and able to do things that, had I been a boy, I could have done with ease. </p><p>grandfather suggested that all the Yandles were probably descended from the same family group, however, reading and writing skills were much less precise in those days, and writers were not always actually skilled in making clear letters or using correct spelling. Many of the brave people who left England, or other European countries were bold and courageous, though not usually actual scholars. </p><p>My Dad told me that a group of people, brothers, cousins, and their wives and their siblings came from England in the 1800’s. One was brothers with the name Yandle came across the ocean from England along with their families in the first half of the 19th Century. One of them was Milas Milton Yandle There is very little real information about who they were, and where they settled, and exactly and though they didn’t all settle in the South, nor did they all settle in the same towns, most of them settled in the Pineville area </p><p>As a child I learned that four Yandle brothers came to the new world which eventually became the United States. Some of them may have gone to the Philadelphia area, and others came into the Carolinas. I do not know for what reason the Yandles decided to leave England, but Milas Milton Yandle was born </p><p>but not everyone knew how to read and write in those days, and therefore spelling from one area of the world was generally somewhat different in other areas, even if words sounded the same. Therefore, when in the early days of the 1800’s, many people left Europe, and specifically England, to begin new lives in America, not all the people were well educated. </p><p>In the first half of the 1800’s people in England, Ireland, and Scotland, often immigrated to America in large family groups. Some years before the War Between the States there was such a time when two families, with the surnames of Yandle and Johnston, entered America. Not all of them immigrated to the same area of America, and not all of them chose the South to be their home territory. However there was a group of people who crossed the Atlantic from England or Ireland to America and either before they left Ireland, or fairly soon after they landed in America, a bunch of them married each other, though some of them probably married before they left England or Ireland. So there were Yandle families and Johnston families who were brothers and sisters and cousins and who settled within the Carolinas not far from the Catawba River. There were at least Four Yandle families and about that many Johnstons</p><p>—there were then new families who’s offspring would be double first cousins. in the early 1800’s with a surname of Johnston, and another bunch who seemed to be members of either a large family of Yandles or a large family of Johnstons, both families with males and females who liked and trusted each other because some were married before they sailed to the New World, and some married pretty soon after they landed. There were at least four grownup Yandle men, and about that many grownup Johnston men, and a bunch of females of marriageable age in both groups. . Some were already married to each other, and some married connected by seemed There was Yandle male who settled in the North with his family, and several of them , part of the new entered at the same time, but all of them They didn’t come all at one time, some into the South, and some into the North. . , along with their children and cousins and in groups of husbands and wives came to America and settled in various parts of the new nation. Some members of the family had come earlier, and were already settled in the Philadelphia area. However, the later group came into the Carolinas. Some scattered beyond the Catawba River into area where the town of Mt Holly was located, and others chose to set up their farms and homes closer to Charlotte, some on North Carolina land, and others on land that eventually became South Carolina. on , and scattered settled on bo Northern part of America in already large cities like Pennsylvania, and a little later another large group of the same people settled in the South.<br/> eneral because at some point in the first half of the 1800’s a bunch of people came to America from England, and a goodly number of them had been Johnstons, and a close to matching number of them were Yandles. Some of the Johnston women were married to Yandle men, and some of the Yandle women were married to Johnston men. There were at least four Yandle brothers. They mostly settled in the Carolinas, but some of them went into settled cities in the North, and at least one member of the family went West, all the way to California. I remember that my Grandmother Yandle, who’s maiden name was Johnston, went with her parents on a very long train ride when she was a child. They crossed the United States from the Pineville area to California in search of her uncle and his family. They had driven across the United States to San Francisco in a covered wagon—parents and children. Letters had come frequently for a time, but after the San Francisco earthquake the family did not hear from the people who had reached San Francisco before the earthquake. The family members were never found—not them, nor any of their possessions. A search was made for their wagon, and the horses that pulled it, as well as for the family members themselves. However no trace of them was every found, and my Grandmother and her parents returned home to North Carolina..</p><p>d by the earthquake. that had and The group probably had and brought with them before the War Between the States there were at least four brothers named Yandle who came to America from England. It seemed that the Yandles had very strong ties to another family with the surname Johnston. Johnston men married Yandle women, and Yandle men married Johnston women and a bunch of Yandles and Johnstons who were married to each other came to America about the same time. My grandmother, Ella Johnston, married Amos Yandle, and Amos’ mother was also a Johnston. Amos’s father </p><p>father was also a Yandle, and several of the Yandles were married to women named Johnston. some of them married into another strong family with the surname Johnston. The Yandle’s and the Johnston’s intermarried frequently enough that by the time that I was born, in 1931, there were lots of Johnston cousins whose families also had settled not only in Pineville, Charlotte, or Mount Holly, but in the same general area, and many of them settled in small towns near the Catawba River, or at least not far from the great river. women was named Johnston. There were some Johnstons married to Yandle women, but there were a few of the Johnston’s who their cousins, their sistersthe same name, that we were not the only people with that name. There were other students in Bethune School who were Yandles, except they spelled it differently. Most of the Yandles I met were not my exact age, nor did the older ones know anyone in my family. Sometimes they spelled their names differently—such as Yandell, or Yeandal—however none of those seemed to know members of my family. <br/> started to went to school in Charlotte, N.C. that I wasn’t the only Yandle in my school. The name was not as popular as Smith, or Jones, but there were at least three other students with that name attending Harding High School, and though the kinship was especially close, and the spelling was not exactly the same (some were Yandall) I decided that they all came from a well represented bunch of Yandles who migrated from England in the early 1800’s. Not all of them entered the Southern part of the country, as at least one of them was as far away as Philadelphia. However, there were three or four brothers, ( and perhaps a few cousins) who, with their families, crossed the sea at close to the same time, and settled in upper South Carolina, and in North Carolina. They all tried to settle close to where a river flowed, and they were mostly farmers, though one of them was a store-keeper. The store-keeper was my Great-Grandfather—the father of my Grandfather. </p><p>Of course, I never knew my Great-Grandfather, but I did hear stories about him. He was a store-keeper, and once he was established, he discovered that even the “new” continent with a “new” kind of government could have troubles, and deep disagreements. He was smack-dab in the middle of the War Between the States. Think how it would be if and the depression caused when the white men went to war to protect their “rights.” The South had lots of people who did not want to free their slave laborers—not because they hated them, nor because they thought them less than human—but because if slaves were free, they could demand wages, and better housing, and better treatment out in the fields. If landowners were forced to accommodate them in order to keep their own way of life, everything would change. Great houses would be too costly, and the easy way of life “rich” families could demand—when they had not been obliged even to comb their own hair—would truly disappear. choress of work their own being part of their everyday lifeThe cheap, rough, inadequate housing they had been allowed as slaves, and the would have to be improved or they would be free to seek jobs elsewhere. </p><p>The economy of the South, where cotton was “King” and the constant labor required to plant, nurture, and harvest that crop could not be maintained without the slaves, the entire economy of the area failed. The rich became paupers, the slaves became jobless in large numbers, and their plight—no homes, no jobs, no friends, no food, no hope—most of them were not really better off as free people than they had been as slaves, and many of them did whatever they had to do to stay alive and protect their families. Like all mistreated folk, some of them turned in anger to “paying back” all the punishment they had endured. Many traveled north where they might be able to find real paying jobs, and some few traveled to the west hoping to be able to home-stead. en they demanded clothing, food, and shelter from at they had to do to survive. fields As free men and women they would want more than the clothes on their backs, and furnishing their needs in addition to paying a salary would ruin the land owner, who would no longer be able to afford the upkeep of his house and property. Without huge fields his income would diminish, and if another plantation could afford higher wages, his devastate the land owner’s way of life. As slaves, their workers could be denied more than absolute necessities—and could “make do” with the bareness of their lives. The field workers would, as free men, have a day off, or work only a certain number of hours each day, however, as slaves they were compelled to work from sunrise to dark, six days a week without a real break. Even children could be put to work as soon as they were able to follow directions. Both girl and boy children and all the slave women could be sexually abused by white men without the right to refuse. In almost every instance</p><p>their own way of life to be compelled to compensate those who worked in their fields. No one could afford to pay enough workers to sow, work, and pick cotton and the other farm products it took to keep the Southern farmers and their families on the scale they enjoyed at that time? If they were forced to pay enough to support the field hands, even if they did not live as richly as their owners now lived, it would still bankrupt the land-owners. If wages had to be paid the cotton fields would not bring enough money to sustain the plantation. </p><p>As a small , and settled into the new continent Not all of them chose the Carolinas, but several did, and several brothers along with their wives and families settled close to Fort Mill, and Pinville. When the Carolinas were separated, there were Yandles in both Carolinas. and —and my paternal ancestors, My Dad, Leroy Samuel Yandle, was born in 1896. My mother, Minnie Parks Yandle, was born in 1902. I was born in 1931, and my husband, Robert Erskine Beatty, was born in 1925.</p><p>The Yandle family immigrated to the United States from England, and We have grandchildren who were born near the turn of the century in the late 1990’s, and both Grandchildren, and Great-grandchildren that were born after the year 2000. Of late I have thought about the many dynamic changes that have occurred, both in our family, and in the world in which we live, in the span of the lives of me and my husband. It is staggering to see the differences from the time settlers first arrived in America and the way it was a few years later. They came in small sailing ships—not a lot larger than a fishing boat of today, but without motors. They had only sails, and very little room for privacy. They would travel for weeks to arrive on the new continent. What they found in the earliest days once they had was at first just endless water, waves, wind, and lots of sky. When they arrived in the new world, they found sand, trees, and sometimes a few Indians. Later, when more people had come from England, when homes of a sort had been built, when there was law and order and some settled people who had planted, or even reaped their fields, life became a little easier. This new world was still not inhabited with very many Europeans or English citizens. </p><p>People came with almost nothing except the clothes they wore, perhaps a few tools and seeds to plant for their food. Sometimes the clothing they wore was almost all they owned. The earlier efforts were not nearly as well prepared as most of the later arrivals. It is amazing what the earliest folk accomplished with so little in the way of tools and equipment. As more ships came, and more goods were delivered, theactually did were able to achieve. When more ships came, with more goods, and more settlers, A little later there were all those horse drawn wagons that carried people to where they needed to go in the days of my Great-grandfather. Of course, when I was a child, I never dwelled on the circumstances of my forebears, or that my grandparents had once been young, though of course, all of them were. I knew both my grandfathers as men who wore overalls, blue ones. I saw my Yandle Grandfather as someone who didn’t play games with me, not at all. He did not converse with me. He was an old man with white hair, and a white, sticky mustache. He was very hard of hearing, and seldom understood anything I said to him, though he seemed to be trying hard to listen. I saw pictures of him in a suit, with vest and coat, however I, my self, usually saw him in blue shirt, blue overalls, and in the winter, sox and shoes. In summer when he was relaxing on the porch, he was always bare footed. id not see him myself in I never saw dressed in anything except blue shirts and blue overalls, and both with and without shoes and socks—he didn’t wear shoes inside the house in warm weather. When I was small I thought it was un polite to trapse into the house to see Grandmother, and leave him alone with the flies on the porch, so I tried to keep him company, and talk to him. That, of course was a problem all it’s own since he was profoundly deaf. He usually said not a word to me. He sat there, killing flies. He never conversed with me, and I didn’t know what to say to him. If I told him something, he didn’t say anything back. One day he saw me take my mother’s purse out of the car and take a nickel out of it. She had given me permission, and I took only the nickel she said I could have—and he said to me, “I saw you!” Therefore I told him my Mother had given me permission. When we got home that night I told Mother what he said, and she told me that he had gone into the sitting room and had told her what I had done. He was trying to keep me on track—and did not want me to be able to sneak money out of my Mother’s purse. Looking at that occurrence now, I can see that he thought he was doing me a favor, so that I would not learn to steal. I guess I should have been grateful that he cared that much about keeping me straight; however I was a little miffed that he even suspected that I would actually steal from my own Mother. Later that day Mother told me that when I went to the service station to get a popsicle he had told her I took a nickel. She told him I had permission. It annoyed me that he would think I would steal. But Mother said he meant it for good, and I didn’t stay mad at him. Grandfather’s feet sometimes swelled up, especially in the summer, and when they did, he took off his shoes because they hurt his feet. I never saw him wear anything more than overalls, but there were family pictures of him wearing a suit and standing near an automobile. By the time I was old enough to recognize him every time I saw him, his hair was white, and he had a white mustache, wore denim overalls, with blue shirts, and in winter wore black shoes. Most of my life when I visited in Summer-time he sat on the porch on a straight backed kitchen chair, and he always had a fly swatter in his hand, both feet bare and on the floor, and looking for flies—with fly swatter in hand. When he had been there for a while, he would be surrounded by a carpet of dead flies, spreading as far out around his chair as he and the fly swatter could reach. From a distance it would look like he had a black colored rug on the porch floor beneath his feet.</p><p>Grandfather Yandle was not talkative. He did have a strong determination about what he should do, or what he simply did not do. When he had something to say, he said it loud and clear. If he had no questions, nor any information to impart, he sat quietly. For the length of Spring, Summer, and early Fall, Grandfather Yandle worked in the fields if he was needed, or he sat on the porch if the weather permitted. It seemed to me that he wished for a little privacy, perhaps even needed quiet time. Therefore he simply stayed out of the way of people when he was not needed to help them. Not necessarily avoiding them, but giving both his wife and children, and himself, a little privacy. Grandfather Yandle did not tease me, or tell me jokes. If I sat with him, even if I talked, he did not always reply, nor did he ask silly questions. I think now, that I enjoyed talking all I wanted to while he listened. At home I had lots of competition since I had an older sister. </p><p>eldom though he loved them, and worked hard for them. He differed from my Parks Grandfather in that he no longer attended church. I am convinced that he did not because he didn’t really have a way to get to the church that was about two miles from his house. it would have been very hard for him since only Aunt Pauline had an automobile, and since she was working five days a week, and also needed to spend some time with her invalid mother. He, himself did not have a buggy, and his church was more than a mile and a half away from his house. My father, who lived in Charlotte, had a car, and his sister Pauline Hunnycutt had a car. After Aunt Martha married, she, too had access to a car. Grandmother was unable to leave her home because of her blindness and her frailty, and the only time she went anywhere in an automobile that I learned about was when she was taken to a hospital in Charlotte, briefly. </p><p>No one in the family, except my f had no automobile and no buggy, He did have a mule that he used to plow—or rather Uncle Eddie used the mule to plow. He was quite old picked cotton when he was very old, and found it difficult to stay on his feet for any length of time. Therefore, he sat on the ground on a burlap sack, and scooted himself down the cotton rows, and placed his picked cotton bolls into another burlap sack that he pulled along with him. When his sack was full, he stood up, and carried it to the large basket used for collecting the bolls, and then returned to his row, to fill his sack again. The baskets would be hauled away on a wagon. The fields were big, and for the most part, were across Pineville Road from the house. </p><p>The home my Grandfather’s family lived in was a two story house, with four rooms and a hall on the first floor, and four rooms and a hall on the second floor. When my Grandmother became blind and was unable to climb stairs, her bed was placed in one of the downstairs room, so that her daughters who had chores in the kitchen could take care of her without climbing the stairs to do it, and so they could hear the tinkle of the bell she used to summon them. Her room was furnished with her bed and dresser, and chairs enough to accommodate the family, and eventually, a large heater in which to build a fire to keep her warm in winter. That room also served as a sitting room. Any visitors to the house would want to visit her, if only to exchange a polite greeting. Grandfather had his bed, and his privacy, upstairs. His early rising to go to work on the farm would not disturb his wife. Also, their daughters, entering the room to take care of their mother would not disturb his privacy. </p><p>There were three daughters and two sons in that family, and for many years all of them were at home. My Daddy and his sister Pauline were the youngest, and when I was a child, the only ones who married. When I was five years old, or so, Pauline had a boy friend, and he became my Uncle Henry. Pauline and Henry owned a car, and I don’t remember what Uncle Henry did, but Aunt Pauline went to Charlotte every week-day to her job. I think Uncle Henry had land, and farmed it, but I am not certain. They rented a house just a short walk from the Yandle home place, with only one other house between them. Aunt Pauline could easily walk from her home to the Yandle home place, and did so frequently. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%</p><p>The four upstairs rooms were in use, so Grandfather, who wanted a little space, and a little privacy of his own, invented a room for himself. Like many homes of that era, the Yandle house was built with a sort of open sitting room at the top of the stairs. However, my Grandfather claimed it as his bedroom, and secured his privacy by extending what looked to me like a rope from wall to wall, hung what looked like a sheet over it, put a double bed behind it, and called it his bedroom. It served him as a private room the rest of his life. </p><p>In mid-summer the Yandle home place, surrounded by tall trees, was shaded very well, but still warm. In winter, there was a stove in the kitchen, of course, and one in my Grandmother’s room. There was a fireplace also in the living room. There was no electricity, no running water, and no toilet. The kitchen was always warm because the wood burning cooking stove kept that part of the house pleasantly warm during the winter, and near to suffocating in summer. </p><p>In summer when Grandfather Yandle was tired, or it was Sunday, or there wasn’t much to do in the fields, he would sit on one of the porches with his fly swatter, and kill flies. When the sun was behind his house he sat on the front porch in the swing, and killed flies. When the sun was shining on the front of the house, he sat on the back porch and killed flies. In summer he always held a fly swatter in his hand, and he seldom missed a target. In winter he sat in the warm downstairs room with his wife, or occasionally in the kitchen.</p><p>My blind grandmother was an invalid, and kept to her bed all day, every day. She had been in fragile health most of her life, though she birthed at least six children, five of whom lived to adulthood. My Dad often told me stories about his youth, sometimes admitting to having to leave the house in freezing cold to fetch a doctor, or to refill her prescription when his mother was ill. He also said that though he went to school, he had to make his grade in only a few months, since he was needed to plough and plant the fields, and again to harvest them. </p><p>I don’t know many stories about my father’s childhood, but there is one he told me one evening as we sat in the living room in our house in Charlotte at 407 West Eleventh Street. My parents had moved there from East Fifth Street when I was about two and a half years old. I have only tiny snatches of fragmentary memories of the first house, but I lived on Eleventh Street in the same house until I married, and my parents stayed there until the City of Charlotte decided to tear down the houses, and build a ramp through that area leading to an Interstate—thereby making it possible to leave the center of town and be on the highway in a matter of about ten minutes. </p><p>My parents had lived on Eleventh Street for about twenty-five years. When they realized they would be compelled to leave their current location they decided to return closer to Pineville. So they searched for a convenient place near family members, and found several acres for sale not far from where Mother’s sister Ola Davis and her husband had lived for at least thirty years. There was already a house on the property; however, it was no longer livable. The house had been built so long ago that at one point it was a stage coach station. It was very small, though it was two stories tall, and had only four rooms. There had once been a separate building that was its kitchen; however, like many kitchens of that era, it burned down. There was a story that during the Revolutionary War the British were in the area and camped on that land. One of their soldiers deserted from that camp, but he was captured and hung on a tree that still sheltered an area where my dad built a storage shed. That land had a very old history, and my Dad had roamed over a large part of that area as a boy. They, of course, built a house my mother designed herself, and they had a lovely place with a large basement, and pleasant yard. There was room for a horse, named Patsy, and a few chickens—the king of the chickens had a name: “Chick-Chick” and it lived for years. He was an indoor chicken, though he was allowed outside, and he ate tidbits from the table, and crowed at my mother to awaken her each morning. He lived in kingly solitude in the basement of that house at night. When Chick-chick died of old age, my parents buried him with a ceremony. </p><p>My mother loved having her sister so close, and they had great times together during that time. Her husband, Uncle Vance, helped to build the house, and contributed greatly to the way it turned out. Not every “self” built house was truly livable, but that house was close to perfect. It saddened my parents and us when, about ten years later, someone really important decided to build a huge building that would need more than the corner property—in fact all of the land my parents owned as well as that of their neighbors. </p><h2 id="therefore-mother-and-daddy-found-a-nice-farm-on-the-other-side-of-charlotte-that-already-had-both-a-small-lake-and-a-good-sized-brick-house-on-it-with-plenty-of-space-for-a-garden-it-also-had-a-second-house-which-was-rented-to-a-nice-family-with-three-children-on-the-back-of-the-property">Therefore, Mother and Daddy found a nice farm on the other side of Charlotte that already had both a small lake and a good sized brick house on it, with plenty of space for a garden. It also had a second house which was rented to a nice family, with three children, on the back of the property.</h2><p>Because my parents grew up close to Pineville I was sorry they had to leave their house there. Mother’s sister and brother-in-law had been only across the road from them in the house they built themselves. Mother’s parents had died some years earlier, and my Dads parents had died a few years later. Pineville is a small town that was once about fifteen miles (give or take a little because it is a guess) from Charlotte. Charlotte was not as large then as it is now, and neither was Pineville. When I first began to notice familiarities along the road, I would ask questions. To my surprise, my Dad, or my Mother, knew a lot about the buildings we passed, and even the spaces that were open fields with jimson grass growing on it, or places where there were stands of tall pine trees for along the way. Occasionally </p><p>Because Charlotte has spread beyond its early boundaries there is now less distance between Charlotte and Pineville. My early first memories of the trips to Pineville began from our house, through Charlotte’s Square, and down South Tryon Street. There was a little ziz-zag around corners, and then we went down East Boulevard, past the Lance Packing Company, the Street-Car Barn, and a corner where people hitching a ride south usually stood. Then we were on Pineville Road, and there were fewer houses, and some businesses. About seven or eight miles down the road toward Pineville we came to curve. If you guided your automobile sort of straight, ignoring the curve of the road, you would find a level crossing of the railroad track, and on the other side of the railroad was a very old road. The old road was wide, but it was paved on only one side. The other side was covered in fine gravel, for horses. . . That was where Pineville Road was re-routed to prevent having the road cross the railroad track twice in the space of about two or three miles. with the road, and not curving, you came to a railroad crossing. If you crossed the railroad you found yourself on what folks called “Old Pineville Road. Now, I don’t know which came first—the muddy path that was the beginning of the road, or the railroad track from Pineville to Charlotte. But however it was, the railroad dug a valley through the middle of a hill, and kept right on chugging. The Road said, well, My Daddy told me that when the government was paving the road, making it safer for wagons and cars, they didn’t want to build a bridge over the railroad track, also laid between Charlotte and Pineville, because just a little way down the railroad track from where we were, the land dropped down, and the train track was way down in low place, avoiding a hill. Well, the folks who made the road just made a little wooden bridge that arched over the narrow width of the track. This was a place where the first Pineville Road that was just a few ruts in the muddy dirt, </p><p>but some buildings where there were businessesWhere are road to Pineville from Charlotte is of a wide cement road with dirt shoulders on both sides of it where Queen Ann’s Lace plants would grow in summer. My Dad usually drove out South Boulevard onto Pineville Road, stopping only at our planned destination. Sometimes we left the highway roughly three miles before we reached Pineville, and crossed the railroad tracks to a streach of . Early in my life, once we , and then we drove Road now is a wide thoroughfare that extends well into the city of Charlotte.

In the days before the family moved to the location I was familiar with . . In hi</p><p>As a small child (five years old up to fifteen years) I didn’t really like to sit still and keep quiet while the grown folks congregated in a stuffy room and talked to my Grandmother. We usually arrived there about two o’clock in the afternoon, and stayed there until about seven, or even eight o’clock in the evening. The adults usually had a chair, even if it was only a straight chair, but I rarely had a comfortable one. The room had two rocking chairs—one for my grandfather, and one for my grandmother, and a couple of chairs just like those in the kitchen that would, when I was small and wearing a short dress, mark my legs in an image of the cane strips that made the seat of the chair.</p><p>Another reason I liked to go to my Grandmother’s house was that there were some young people near my sister’s age who lived about two houses down the road, and she enjoyed playing with them. Perhaps by the time I was ten or so, they were not exactly playing together, but swapping information about being teenagers. It didn’t bother me that I was not invited, I didn’t know them, and my sister didn’t want me around, and that left me with several pleasing options. Almost always there were cats, or kittens, or both, around the porch. There was a dog there—and usually the animals “belonged” to Aunt Helen. Oodles of chickens strutted in the back yard. The milk cow and the mule were in a pasture behind the well house, and the barn was about twenty feet from the gate that was just behind the well house. If I wanted to take a walk, I had several options. There was a gas station with a little store inside it next door </p><p>I could walk up a seldom used red dirt road, and choose whether I wanted to walk all the way to the train track and throw a few rocks because the track had lots of rocks in its middle between the cross-ties, and both between and beside the tracks were wonderful white or gray rocks one could toss. </p><p>I didn’t mind sneaking to a small building beside the well, but beneath the limbs of a sheltering tree. The building had a concrete floor and there was usually water from the well several inches deep on the floor. Most of the time the well house was cool—or perhaps just cooler than—the rest of the yard. Because there was no refrigerator in the house, the milk was stored in the well house, along with any other perishables, such as butter. As a very small child I accepted as a fact that the well house was cool, without much curiosity about how it worked. I think, well trained child that I was, that the older folk in that house, such as my Uncle and my three Aunts, as well as both my Grand Parents, were indelibly marked in my head as people to whom small children were simply an aggravation. I don’t recall that I was unhappy about not having a playmate. My sister was enough older than me that she that on any occasion. I do remember that I worked hard not to “bother” them, mostly by keeping my mouth shut, staying outside, if possible. My Aunt Hellen loved cats, and there was a dog there. My Aunt Pauline also had a dog—a huge critter named Bo, who looked like it could easily eat me. When I was outside, I tried to have either my Aunt Helen’s dog, or Bo, with me when I was outside alone. When a or, when I became nine or ten years old, walking over to my Aunt Pauline’s house while she was visiting at her mother’s house, and listening to her radio. I also had permission to wear one of her housecoats that I thought was as beautiful as any evening gown I had ever seen in any movie. I would put it on, take off my shoes, and dance in her living room to radio music. I always thought of My Uncle Eddie, Aunt Helen, and Aunt Martha as folk who, without doubt, didn’t want to be bothered with the questions of little kids. </p><p>The </p><p>To top all that, the property where the house stood had been sold, the house torn down, and a hardware store built on the site. </p><p>bother the horse or the cow, and didn’t like the pigs, and stayed away from the chickens because I didn’t like the deposits they left behind them. That left me time to play with the dogs, and when I was ten or so I had the freedom to walk across the yard to a house where very interesting people lived, who were always polite to me. </p><p>to visit the house very near where some extremely interesting people lived. I was old enough to know a little bit about black people and that some years before they had been slaves. </p><p>I might explain that dear little dimpled Shirley Temple was making movies—marvelous, and new, and never-before-anything-like-it-movies. She was cute, pretty, talented, a dancer, a singer, a precious little actress who inspired every woman who viewed her movies whether or not she had a girl child that age, to want a girl child that age because she was smart and was a movie star with cute dimples. I actually had a child sized paper doll of Shirley, nearly as tall as I was, with about six paper dresses so that she could change to suit the imaginary situation. About that time I loved to p’like. You don’t know what that means? Oh! I’ll spell it. PLAY LIKE. You know—Let’s p’like I’m Shirley Temple and you are Jane Withers and we have a horse.</p><p>Every mother in the entire United States immediately cut all the hems off all the dresses their little darlings wore so that if her child bent over she would reveal that her little panties matched her very short dresses, just like Shirley Temple. Of course, because of the Depression, some children couldn’t have a bought dress—but if her mommy could sew, she could make one. </p><p>’s sitting room. mtin a dim room and talked. The only lights were kerosene lamps, and they were not—repeat—NOT burned in the day time, despite however dim it was in Grandmother’s room. Since she was blind, it was assumed that no one else had a right to bright light, either. So we all sat in dimness. There were two windows in her room, both of which should have provided some brightness, however, one of them opened onto the back porch with a wide and shady roof, and from the other we could see a bunch of leaves very close to the glass from a tall as well as large bush that kept out bright light. One did not wriggle around in a comfortable chair inside that room, either. There were only two “good” chairs. One was a pillowed rocker with a high back that would allow grandmother to lay her head against it, and the other was a large and sturdy rocker complete with cushions and pillows, which would accommodate my Grandfather. Uncle Eddie sat on a kitchen chair, and so did all other visitors. If the room had enough people in it to use up all the chairs that were normally there, I was elected to sit on a small foot-stool that was in reach of Grandmother’s feet, should there not be a chair for me. If more persons came to visit, chairs without cushions were brought from around the kitchen table that were so old that the legs of the chairs looked as if they had been sand-papered to shorten their length. Of course it was because they had been pushed up to, and away from the table for probably more than fifty, or even seventy five or more years, against a rough floor. The shortening of the legs was not on purpose, but simply the result of their use for three meals of each day for long years by more than one generation. We actually have a couple of those chairs at our table, today, and they have cushions that lift the person who sits on it a little higher. The legs of those chairs are quite short. The cane strips that are woven front to back and side to side to provide the seat of the chairs will, if you sit on them long enough and are wearing shorts or a short skirt, leave your legs with its imprint, making your legs seem to be of woven wood. </p><p>Granddaddy Yandle, had a special chair, big enough to hold him, with soft cushions and arms If there were other people who needed to sit, they did so on kitchen chairs. </p><p>On summer afternoons when we visited my Dad’s family Grandfather Yandle was almost always on either the front porch, or the back porch, according to which porch was toward the sun. In summer he was never without a fly swatter. Usually at the end of the day both porches would be covered with dead flies. <strong><em>*</em></strong>*d of the day, the porch deck was literally covered with dead flies. I was small enough at that time to remember a fairy tale about a man who killed seven flies with one swat, and in an effort to make himself seem fierce he made a sign that said “I killed seven with one blow” without defining who his victims were. I thought my Grandfather should certainly have a better sign than that, as I was unable to count all the flies he left on the porch deck. </p><p>I must confess that I am seventy-five years old. My husband, Robert Erskine Beatty, is eighty years old. My youngest grandchild is about eight years old; however I have great-grandchildren that are still infancy. My father sometimes spoke of his childhood, mentioning his Grandfather Yandle who ran a grocery store near Pineville. That Great Grandfather and his wife came to the United States before the Civil War, but they had been born and raised in England. He brought with him two younger people—a man and a woman—and I have been unable to determine exactly who they were, or what exact kin they were to me. I called them Uncle Ed, and Aunt Lizzie. I am still confused about which of the generations of my forebears they fit into. They were brother and sister, and they lived in Charlotte when I was very small. Aunt Lizzie called my grandmother Yandle “Sissy” as if they were sisters, however, my Grandmother Yandle was not born in England. they were not blood kin. However my grandmother was not blood kin to them. My grandfather definitely did not have an English accent, though he didn’t talk to me very much, and seldom had very much to say when the family was sitting around the stove on Sunday afternoons in the winter. I, myself, liked to be outside when I was there if the weather was nice. In winter I sat in the room with the grownups and listened to their conversations. and around. My Uncle Ed sort of did have an accent that was not a southern brogue. </p><ul><li>brother and sister, whom I knew simply as Uncle Edward, and Aunt Lizzie. When I was a child, I simply didn’t understand how they were connected to the rest of our family—but I was certain there was a connection somewhere, or they would not be my “Aunt” or my “Uncle”. My English Great Grandfather, whom I never saw because he died long before my birth, owned a store, and the two of his family that I knew well were extremely well educated, and had vocabularies that differed from that of us Southerners. I always marveled at why they were treated with such obvious courtesy. I understood that they were not like everyone else, and that we always treated them as if we were honoring their presence—when I, as a small child, always thought of them as a nuisance—especially as I was warned to be on my best behavior when they were visiting. as if they were much better, nicer, and worthy of courtesies than other folk. They, themselves seemed to think they were entitled to deference. As a little child, I just—well my grandchildren of today would say that I was just “going with the flow,” however, I couldn’t see why those people “deserved” more courtesy than my own parents. as a small child I didn’t know why they were different, nor that they had once lived in England. I realized their manners and their opinions were sometimes radically different from those held by my parents, but I didn’t discover much about them until I was studying a family tree. Their house had always had running water. They had gas lights in their house, as well as electricity. since it came from a well, knew my Great Uncle Edward, and my Great Aunt Elizabeth, who was called “Lizzie”. I realized then that they spoke a little differently than most folks, but I didn’t know why. For instance, their house had electric lights; however, they also had gas lights in their home. They did not have a complete “Southern Drawl” and no one every mentioned that they had been raised by people who had lived in England. I knew without doubt that they were somehow different from my Mother’s people whose ancestors had come earlier to what is now The United States. My childish explanation was that they were just a little odd, and that sometimes people simply turned out that way. I also believed Great Aunt Elizabeth, and Great Uncle Edward were just a bit snooty, believing themselves a bit better than anyone else. just theythoughthat in some ways they were “different” from people who had a southern drawl. I just thought they were a little bit (not really very much) sort of “dotty”. That means I thought they were not quite “with it” as more any more recent teenager might explain it. as a because they were and because I knew them when I was very young, I thought they were verand his wife came to this country from England, much earlier, and established a home in either Pineville, or Charlotte. I never learned exactly where he lived. He owned a store. I don’t know exactly what kind of store it was, but food was one part of its wares. The name of this ancestor was Samuel Yandle. That much I know, because his wife, in extreme old age, repeated a poem, a verse, or a little song about him. I never met the gentleman, however, my mother helped to nurse his widowed wife when she was close to a hundred years old, and told me, and showed me, how she rocked, slapping her feet softly onto the floor with her feet matching the rhythm of her rocker, in strict cadence of the sing-song poem. Over and over again the tiny lady would rock and sing. Then my mother told me that if she, herself, was careless and walked close to that chair, a small hand, but still strong one, would pinch her severely, leaving a bruise, so that my Mother took great care not to fall prey to her little idiosyncrasy. , all day, as she rocked in her rocking chair, and since my mother helped take care of her she told me about that old lady who, though a little crazy, could still sing when she was near a hundred years old. My mother helped take care of her for a while, and she recited the sang the song for me. It went like this, to the squeak of her rocking chair, and the tap of her shoes against the wooden floor:<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>        Samuel Yandle is my name,

For instance, every little girl who lived when a child Movie star named Shirley Temple played in kids movies suddenly found herself in dresses that barely covered her privates. That, my dears, was STYLE! That style marked a sweet, intelligent, pretty, and modern little girl. I know. I was one of those little girls who wore short dresses; however, my mother always made me a pair of underpants that matched the dress so it wouldn’t be too noticeable—she wanted me to be fashionable, but lady-like, too. Who cares that dresses were (short or long) when it was (ten or twenty or only five) years ago? Change is inevitable in almost every facet of life, and the living of it. Change often depends on new discoveries is And now I am looking back to the time when I was very young. Life really is different for people born years apart. Sometimes the length of time matters, sometimes changes come quickly, and leave just as quick, that they are just a “notion” or a “quirk” that stirs folks for a short while. Sometimes However, changes come, and they go also. Knowledge usually increases, however in huge and then increases more, and more.

The United States had been a nation—not just a colony—for about one hundred fifty years when Paw-paw was born in 1925. . Many new citizens arrived by ship from all over the world, beginning at the time the rest of the world heard about the new continent. Actually, it hasn’t stopped yet. <strong>*</strong>l today. simply because this was a “new” country, and there was lots of room, and the people who came were usually sort of running from some unpleasant situation in the country they were born in. whatever situation they had found themcame to the New World In the late 1800’s and the early 1900’s. For one thing, travel became easier as time passed. lots of people from all over the world came to this new nation to make a new start in how they lived their lives. Our country was still relatively young, but we were growing. There had been many changes in the country since its beginnings. The Civil War in the mid 1860’s had taken a toll on the South, but in the Twentieth Century most of the people in Southern states had begun to recover from the effects of that war, and jobs were again available, and prosperity could be found in many parts of the South. Mills and factories were built in the South, and railroads crossed the land. Cities were growing, jobs were available, and the children of Negro citizens were not accepted in white schools, nor were they welcomed into the houses of white people except as servants. Often in large cities persons of color were unwelcome. I can remember that in Charlotte, North Carolina, Negroes who ventured into the up town areas could not use the same rest rooms that white people used. There were two fountains from which to drink—and one of them was for Negroes. often able to send their children to school, though most of them, especially in the South, were restricted to certain areas of a town or city, and few of them were taught in schools. </p><p>had The late 1920’s were not halcyon years. There had been a boom of good fortune in the early 1900’s because the damage of the Civil War and its aftermath was beginning to wane. Jobs were plentiful, homes . was being overcome, and the late 1800’s, after the close of the Civil War, earlier, gold had been found in California and Alaska. The nation was growing, buildings were erected in towns, homes were built, jobs were plentiful, railroads were extended, airplanes were invented and put to work, a war was fought in Europe and our troops won, though the price—the loss of lives—was devastating. there was still a frontier, however, that wild frontier was rapidly being tamed. However we were still a relatively new country, and all over the world things inventions were changing the methods of farming, of . e of the most important ones was that we were not afraid of new things—and in our country machines replaced horses, buggies, and horse or mule pulled plows. We, as a nation, were using machines instead of horses and mules. Many kinds of motors were coming into use. Instead of horses Engines pulled trainsof many kind were appearing in homes. Things like dish washers, electric stoves or gas stoves instead of wood burning stoves were available in towns and cities. not afraid nearly two hundred years when Paw-paw was born</p><p>In the mid to late 1920’s and the early 1930’s Charlotte was becoming a large city—not just a town—and rules of conduct where children were concerned was changing. There were many states that had no rules about child labor, but when farmers, or mill owners, needed simple tasks, they could hire small children, pay them almost nothing, and keep them on the floor of a mill with a broom for ten hours. That was a fact.</p><p>Paw-paw was blessed, as I was blessed, by our parents. Our folks did not require their small children to work when they were so young. However when Paw-paw’s parents, and my parents were growing up, things were different.</p><p>Here is a short story about life and the living of it in the late 1800’s, and the early 1900’s, events that could, and did happen, when our parents were young. My Dad had a neighbor, who was kin to his family. There were several children in that family, among them a four year old girl. It was quite legal to hire children in mills to sweep the floors of lint from the cotton. In this instance, the child’s father took her to the mill, and they put her to work sweeping lint from the floor of the mill, right in the middle of the huge machines that made cotton cloth. The normal shift for the mill was at least ten, and possibly twelve, hours for each shift. It was against the rules for a worker to sit down during the work day. Therefore, the little girl could not sit down during her day’s work. However a kind overseer allowed the child to lean against a pillar holding up the roof, and so long as she didn’t sit down, she could rest or even go to sleep standing up. Her day was not limited to eight hours—but was at least ten hours, or possibly even twelve hours because there were no rules or laws to prevent such demands by the mill owners. The child worked in that mill until she was twelve years old, at which time a young boy, who was about fourteen years old, came to work in the mill. Each day he saw the girl, and learned that she could not spend any of her wages, as they were paid to her father. They ate their lunches which were brought from home, together, and talked to each other for some weeks. The boy admired the girl for her strength and for her sweetness. He thought her father was mean, and that the girl deserved to be treated better. </p><p>There were no laws that would protect her, and she would “belong” to her parents until she was married, or until she was twenty-one years old—twelve more years without going to school, twelve more years without being able to spend a penny of the money she earned. Her only hope of leaving her work at the mill was to get married. However, how would she ever meet s person to marry when she worked twelve hours a day? </p><p>The young man’s last name was Crump, and he was not much older than the girl, but there were few rules about how old a person had to be to get married. And one day he asked the girl to marry him, and told her that as his wife she would not have to work in the mill. She did not hesitate. The license was purchased, the preacher was talked into marrying them, and the girl was free from her father. </p><p>Except for the anger of her father who could not now snatch her wages from her, the marriage worked just fine. She left the mill and became a house wife. Her young husband realized that she had done little except work in the mill all of her life. She had never played games with other children, nor did she go to school. She knew that some children did play, and that they pretended to have “houses” that were simple lines drawn in dirt to indicate rooms and walls. Of course, she knew how to do household chores, because she had done them at home. She did not work in the mill on Sunday, so she had home chores on that day. </p><p>Alone in a small house with her young husband the young girl was busy keeping house, and cooking meals. During the part of the year when they first married it was still daylight when her husband came home from work, she would serve him supper, and then if it was still light outside, he would go out into the yard with her, and they would draw lines in the dirt, outlining the rooms of a house, naming the rooms, and then pretend to furnish them. It was play. It was pretending. She had never before done that. </p><p>When I saw the couple they were middle-aged. She was tall and slender and very pretty. He was well filled out—but not at all fat. He had been to school and become a preacher, and was serving a church not too far from Pineville. She had educated herself, and was a slender and quite beautiful lady. The only time I saw them was the day they visited my Grandmother Yandle who was blind. They stopped in that Sunday afternoon to visit, and they had a happy time talking with each other, and with my parents. They prayed with us before they left my Grandmother’s room. I watched the Preacher help her into their car, and then enter the car himself. That was the first time I had ever noticed that men did that. </p><p>After we went home that evening, my father told me a tiny sequel to the story of Pastor Crump and his child bride. He told me how terribly angry her father was when the marriage took place without his consent. My Dad also explained that what her father disliked most was that she would not be giving him her pay check any more. Not long after that marriage the father of the young wife was in Pineville with a younger daughter named Sophie. As they walked down the street the father saw the brother of the Crump boy who had married his older daughter, and he was still so angry that he shouted to his little girl: “Run, Sophie, run. Here comes another Crump, and he’ll have you and gone with you!” My dad thought the old man’s anger was funny, and laughed. I, too, smiled when he told the story. However, I have always wondered about the other children in that family, and how they were treated. If a parent was mean to one child, would the others be treated differently? I was grateful that I was never made to do chores too difficult for me—and though I disliked “kitchen duty” it had not been my parents who demanded that I “learn” how to wash dishes—that was my sister, who when she was near seven years old was suddenly, and without the slightest hint of change or of what to expect, introduced to a tiny sister who cried a lot, had stinky diapers that she was compelled to help wash on a scrub board in a tin tub set on two chairs in the kitchen, and then she was expected to hang them out in a freezing cold back yard since it was February when I was born, and usually quite cold. Ella Cornelia resented me totally. She had not been told that a child was on its way. My mother was definitely expecting, but my sister had no clue that change was on the way before it actually arrived. All she knew was that one day Pauline Funderburk drove up to our house, took her mother away, and left her with Aunt Martha. I was a surprise, but not a welcome one. She had been the only child of my parents. She was the only Yandle grandchild, the only child in our family, and didn’t have much competition in my mother’s family either, as the other Parks grandchildren lived in South Carolina and were not constant visitors to their grandparents. Ella Cornelia was the center of attention every where she went—that is until I came along. </p><p>No sensitive person could blame her for being a little upset to discover—without warning—that she had competition who was the center of every visit, and moreover, had become the most important person in the house, also, with the neighbors, and then to everyone who came through the front door. They all came to “see” that dratted baby, and scarcely said hello to her, and most of them wanted to know how she “liked” that little interloper. Well—to be honest—she didn’t. Didn’t like me I mean. She didn’t like it when visitors came in and said hello, Ella Cornelia, where is baby Iris Jean? THAT did it!! Ella Cornelia had been the only child in the Yandle family for seven years. She had not been told I was on the way, so that I was a terrible shock. My father was, at that period, the only one in his immediate family who was married. His brother and one of his sisters never married, and two of his sisters eventually married, however, neither of them had children. My sister and I were the only Yandle grandchildren. My Uncle Eddie, my father’s only brother, was never married. </p><p>When Ella Cornelia was born she was the only grandchild on the Yandle side of our family.<br/> She, therefore, had close to seven years as the only important child in Charlotte or Pineville. She was the total center of attention to her blind grandmother, her grandfather, her Aunt Helen who was usually in the kitchen, her Aunt Martha who had some training as a nurse and looked after our blind grandmother. Then, there was Aunt Pauline who no longer lived in the house with her parents because she had married Uncle Henry. They had rented a house only a three minute walk away from the farm where she had lived until she married. She was close enough to come to see her family everyday. </p><p>Since Ella Cornelia had been very ill when I was about three years old, I, with my apparent health, received less attention from my Yandle Aunts and Uncles. I was an unwelcome chore when I visited them—too young to be of any help, and a nuisance to take care of. However my sister was the first grandchild, and doted on. Because she was the first grandchild, and then had been so grievously ill, and now needed careful nursing, she became even more the important grandchild. She was so important that I was sort of invisible when I was around, unless Aunt Martha wanted to “play” with me. Her favorite game was to snatch my small panties down and pinch my fanny. She would follow me from the kitchen down the hall, through the dining room and into the kitchen again with me moving as fast as my small legs would carry me to stay out of her reach. However, she was right behind me pinching my fanny, and laughing. </p><p>I was too young at the time to remember how long I stayed in the house where Aunt Martha lived, but I do know that for several months I lived with my mother’s sister, Ola, who had no children of her own. I had not seen much of my Aunt Ola, but she was kind to me, and took good care of me. She was, however, somewhat of a stranger. </p><p>Aunt Ola was a bit older than my mother. She and Uncle Vance had no children. Aunt Ola had not had as much “schooling” as my Mother, who was the younger. Aunt Ola was a wonderful, intelligent, and gifted person. I seldom saw her sitting down except late in the evening or on Sundays. <strong><em>*</em></strong>. , willing to help people who needed help. She was intelligent, a hard worker, she loved my mother and she loved and took care of her parents, taking both of them into her own home after her mother became too old to cope on her own. had a heart attackwhen her mother was no longer able to but she had not been around small children very much, and I was just a frightened young child being handed from here to there because my sister was ill. and the constant sicknesses in the household of my Grandmother Yandle had often made any visits to her short. So much so that I was sort of invisible when I was around. also because of her illness, was the very center of attention. Eventually I was sent to my mother’s sister, my Aunt Ola, and Ella Cornelia stayed with Aunt Martha and her family. Aunt Martha was already nursing Grandmother Yandle who was bedridden, and blind. By that time my grandmother was bedridden and blind, and when I was about two, going on three, my sister was seriously ill, and was not allowed to walk for a full year. Once she was out of the danger of dying any minute, but was still extremely fragile. During her training Aunt Martha had become ill, and she did not finish her training. Her skills came in quite handily when my sister was sent to , she was sent to Pineville to be nursed by her Aunt Martha who had studied to be a nurse, though she had been unable to complete her studies. Mother would never have allowed her to go except for one thing. The Depression had occurred, and money to pay doctors, and buy medicines had to be earned, and as Daddy was working as hard as he could to put food on the table and rent a roof over our heads, Mother went to work to buy medicine. , andBecause my mother had to go to work to pay the hospital and doctor bills, Ella Cornelia, who was still not allowed to stand or walk, she was sent to her Yandle grandparents, aunts and uncle to stay neither of them could get up and walk. My sister had to use a wheelchair for a full year after she was released form the hospital. She was not allowed to “do” anything. I was too young to be of help, and therefore I was a little nuisance, and often sent to stay a while with my Aunt Ola, or someone else. Aunt Ola was my Mother’s sister, and she offered me her attention and love, tried very hard to take good care of me. However, she had never had a child of her own, and though she tried very hard to take good care of me, I think I may have been a little bit afraid of her. Years later she told me that I had been difficult to look after, and that one day when she washed my hair, she had a tough time calming me afterwards. She said I kicked and screamed, and kept saying, “You went and wet my hair!” I think it took a while to calm me, and on the occasions some years later when I spent a few days with her, I remember that I tried very hard not make problems for her. I had, during that long ago visit, given her enough grief to last the rest of my life. Therefore, I owed it to her to be “good as gold” when I visited. She was always kind to me, and during the time my sister was so terribly ill, Aunt Ola kept me at her house, doing the best she could to look after me, when she had no child of her own, and had never before had the opportunity to learn how to take care of a little child. </p><p>My Daddy’s sister, Aunt Martha, was both tall and hefty, and loved to tease me. I’m not sure why she thought it was funny to pull down my diaper, or later, my underpants and pinch my butt, however that was one of her funniest tricks. She would walk behind me as I tried to out run her down the hall of her house, and she would walk behind me, laughing, and reach down to jerk down my panties, and pinch me. I was too small to keep enough distance between us to prevent it, but I tried hard to run faster than she could walk. I never won the race. She always reached me, and then was unhappy with me because I cried. Usually when I was included in a visit with my Yandle Aunts and Uncle, I was careful to stay out of reach if I could. My parents never understood why I wasn’t in a hurry to hug and kiss my Dad’s sisters. I was wary of everyone except Uncle Eddie, who gave me dimes for my bank, but never aggravated me. </p><p>My Grandmother and Grandfather Yandle, and my Daddy’s sisters, all seemed to love Ella Cornelia but they also seemed to dislike me. I could not understand it, and wondered if it was because Ella Cornelia was named after both her grandmothers: Ella for Grandmother Yandle, and Cornelia for Grandmother Parks. I thought both names were nice. I was named by my sister—only she didn’t know she was naming a real person. She had a pretend playmate she called Iris Jean, when she was quite young. That turned out to be my name. However I answered to “Jimmy”, and anything else anyone wanted to call me. However, my sister was always called her full name: Ella (for Grandmother Ella Yandle) and Cornelia (for Grandmother Parks). There could be no preference since both ladies were alive and well aware of her name, and the importance of it. I, of course, was named by my sister. It seems that she had an invisible playmate when she was young, and its name was “Iris Jean”. Of course when I was old enough to understand that Ella Cornelia had furnished my name, I was not only surprised, but a little angry. She didn’t even LIKE me, much less love me. And she certainly was not famous for doing nice things for me—she was more likely play a trick that would end with me in tears, or ready to knock her to kingdom come. I wasn’t named after real person. I was named after a make believe person—and she was invented by my sister, who didn’t have a kind word to say about me when we were young.. </p><p>I, of course, was a little angel—and never gave trouble. I couldn’t have been more than three when Ella Cornelia contracted an illness that could have taken her life. There were lots of children who lived on East Fifth Street at that time, and a bunch of them enjoyed playing jump rope. One hot summer day when my sister was about ten years old she played jump rope with a large group of neighbor children. Jump Rope took a team to be really interesting. There were rules. Two players were chosen to be the turners of the rope. The other children were jumpers, and usually there were two teams of jumpers. I’m not sure how my sister played the game, but she was a jumper. Two others turned the rope, and a bunch of kids started jumping the same rope. If a jumper landed on the rope, or touched it, that jumper was out of the game. When only one jumper was left, that person had the opportunity to jump ten turns of the rope, and if no mistake was made, she had won a second try for her team, and the game started all over again. Well, on that day my sister was the jumper who was the last one still jumping, and she kept right on jumping until she had jumped ten times without touching the rope. Then her friends rejoined her, and they all jumped again until there was, again, only one jumper left, and that was my sister, again, and again she jumped ten turns of the rope without touching it, and again her team returned to the rope, still turning in a distinct rhythm again, and again her team mates joined her, and again they all, eventually, touched the rope—all except my sister. This happened ten times. Ella Cornelia was excited with her triumph. She bragged to our parents that she had done it. She had been the one who was still in the game and who kept on jumping ten turns of the rope so that her playmates could join her again.</p><p>It was a mighty victory, but like all battles, there was a toll. And my poor sister, pleased with her stamina, contracted pleurisy and fevers. Her physician, a dear man named John Ashe, put her in the hospital. Her condition worsened. Three consulting physicians said she would die. Dr. Ashe said she would live. Mother and Daddy put their trust in God, and in Dr. Ashe. And Ella Cornelia did live. However it was not an easy victory. When the surgery was over, and she had been in the hospital for a long time, she was no longer the strong jump rope jumper. She was not allowed to walk for a year because her heart was damaged. During that year my mother asked her sister, Ola, to keep me. Aunt Ola was, first and foremost, a person who had been born on a farm, and had lived on a farm all of her life. She had gone to school, just as my mother had. Aunt Ola was married to Uncle Vance, a gentle sort of man, who was intelligent, and a hard worker. He had built their house on what was called “Old” Pineville Road. There was also a railroad track that passed through both Pineville and Charlotte</p><p>Charlotte was an old city. Pineville was about the same age, but much smaller. Charlotte became a very large city, extending it’s boundaries until Pineville was only about ten miles from the city limits of Charlotte. I am certain that a paved road has existed between the two for at least seventy-five years, because I don’t have a memory of a dirt road, or a black-top road along that route. Pineville Road was at some point, definitely, a trail, because parts of the trail were still in use when I was a child. Some years before the road between Charlotte and Pineville, that was, probably about fifteen miles distanta steep hill. The front of his house lay on high ground, and to step onto his front porch was one, and only one, short step. If one walked to the back of his house, he would find it slightly downhill all the way, and at the rear of his house were tall steps, easily climbed to a nice wide platform carefully fenced to avoid an accidental fall to the ground. The stairs had a banister. where a door opened into his screened back porch. straight up to his back door that led into a screened in porch</p><p>long the side of his house to the rear, one would walk down hill, and find that there was a considerable basement workshop beneath the house. Wide, tall stairs went up to a square porch, with shelf-like banisters on two sides, an entrance to the house on the other. However how to attend to chickens, cows, and probably horses, and both her father and her husand kept horses. She had probably cooked most of her life, because she was the oldest girl in her family (while my mother was the youngest). Aunt Ola had no children, but she looked after several children at least for a while, during her life, and I was one of them. She was kind to me. When My mother’s brothers were nice men. One, Dennis, married a wife named Mary, and they had three children: Dennis, Jr., Patsy, the oldest girl, and Mary Cole, the youngest. Uncle Luther also married, however his wife could have no children. </p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">no</span><span class="w"> </span><span

She had four physicians, and three of them said she would not live because of her illness. Dear Dr. John Ashe said, yes, she will. And he was correct. </p><p>That didn’t rope and had to leave the game. and she did it ten times, jumping all the while Therefore, all her team mates could return to the game. When she had , and when her entire team except for herself had touched the rope, she alone was still jumping so she jumped ten turns of the rope, and earned a second chance for her team and so the others rejoined her, and eventually with several folks jumping the same rope her buddies eventually touched the rope, and were out of the game until she jumped ten perfect jumps again. Then without resting, the game went on. That evening she reported that she had jumped ten games, and each time she was the one left in the game, and she jumped ten perfect jumps ten times. edjumped with a group, and when everyone except her was out, she jumped ten perfect jumps, and her team was in the game again. She was clever, and strong, but she did not listen to her body, nor rest, nor drink water, and she jumped until her several team members were all out, then she jumped ten turns of the rope, and got them all back in the game again. until it started over again. When there was only one jumper left who had not touched the rope, that jumper could jump correctly ten turns of the rope, and her team could return to the game. </p><p>Well, my sister was a good jumper. And on a warm day she jumped for a long time, until she was the only jumper left, and then she jumped ten turns of the rope without touching it, and her team could rejoin her and jump until there was only one jumper left. Remember that this was a summer day. My sister jumped ten full games of jump rope, and was the last one on the team still jumping so that it was she who jumped ten turns of the rope without touching it, and therefore she had not had a rest, nor water, and was worn out at the end of the game. That night she spiked a fever. She went to the doctor. She was sent to the hospital. She grew worse, and it is difficult to understand that at that time there were no antibiotics. People who were sick mostly either got well or they died. Of course there were medicines, but nothing like penicillin had been discovered. She had fever, her lungs were filling with fluid, she was going to drown in her own fluids. Then her doctor drained out the liquid from her lungs, but she was very ill. There were at least four, maybe five physicians attending her. Four of them said that the kindest thing was to make her as comfortable as possible until she died—they had no hope. One doctor, said treat her, and she can live. He won. </p><p>I mentioned that there were no medicines that could truly kill germs. Persons who suffered from contagious illnesses such as tuberculosis were whisked off to a special hospital for people with that disease. That solved the problem of a contagious illness spreading all over a hospital, and therefore all over a city, ruining everyone exposed to the disease. There were no—repeat no—curatives for illnesses of that nature. Because tuberculosis and leprosy had no cures, people stricken needed hospitalization. But they could not mingle with healthy people because the diseases were so easy to contract, and epidemics with vast consequences had to be avoided. Sometimes flu, or typhoid, or many other known diseases could strike a community and hundreds of people could die. It happened. It happened in the United States. It happened when I was a child. I saw the damage Poliomyelitis could spread in a city, in a state. It happened in the mountains of North Carolina. Hundreds of people contracted the disease and none of the powerful antibiotics we have today were yet discovered. People became ill, and they either died, or were crippled for the rest of their lives. Some lost only the use of their legs, others lost almost all control of their bodies, and those whose lungs were affected lived only with an apparatus to breathe for them. </p><p>Some physician somewhere discovered that our bodies could tolerate and defend themselves if only a tiny bit of some illness were injected into the arms of patients. Therefore, injections of small doses of severe illnesses were given to perfectly well people, and it caused their bodies to create antibodies to fight it, so that those people would never be sick with that disease. used to help our own immune systems fight them should children come in contact with the disease. </p><p>injected could result in our own bodies building an army of anti-bodies within us, and with a tiny little shot, people could become immune to the illness. That was when shots began to be given in tiny doses to small children, so that they would never contract the disease. Their bodies could easily fight off a terrible illness by making antibodies to fight it. </p><p>In the 1930’s all children had to be inoculated to prevent small pox, a disease that killed half the people wherever it became an epidemic. Typhoid feva enough yphoid was like that. Some of the children’s diseases such as measles could turn into sort of plague, and there were debilitating illnesses that could devastate a community if the illnesses could not be controlled. that jumped from one person to aa cause that could be and not aiding , because if they were kept in an ordinary hospital they could give their nurses and doctors the disease, and spread it to everyone they came in contact with—including other patients. Therefore, tuberculosis patients were sent to hospitals that accepted only tuberculosis patients. where there were people sick with other illnesses, they could also become ill from those illnesses.. or other </p><p>surgery. She had pleurisy and another complication also. the game began again. without , and that one had not touched the rope, the last jumper in the group could, by jumping the turned rope ten times, begin the jumping session again, with all those in the group jumping usually at high speed, she could then invite her teammates to return and jump with her. . When I was in school years later, there were two teams in that game., and they were divided into two teams. </p><p>she was still compelled to use a wheelchair. She was whining one day, wanting something, and Mother was doing about three things at one time. I think she was scrubbing our laundry by hand on a metal “wash board” to get the dirt and stains out, and making a lunch at the same time. Ella Cornelia was being impatient, and saying things that would cue mother to “build up her ego and make her feel good” so my mother was trying to soothe her temper tantrum, when, all of a sudden, I helped her out. I told my loving sister I agreed with her, I let her know I was sympathetic. I sang a little song for her. It went like this: “Poor Ugly Cornelia, poor ugly Cornelia.” Young as I was, it didn’t surprise me that she didn’t appreciate it, and when she threw her shoe at me, I dodged it. </p><p>When my sister became ill, there were five or maybe six doctors who examined her, and consulted on her treatment. Four of them said she was so very sick that she would not live through her sickness. If she did pull through, she would be an invalid. There was one doctor, Dr. John R. Ashe, who said she would live. Dr. Ashe was not only Ella Cornelia’s doctor, he was also mine. He was the one doctor who did not give up on my sister. He treated her as well as he could in that time when there were no antibiotics, precious little, too. It was always Ella Cornelia should be watched over, and pampered. I, of course, was healthy, and strong. I could always wait for “next time” or I was too young to realize that she always got first dibs on anything, and if there was something she wanted, she got her desire much quicker than I did, and if I finally got something, it often cost less than hers, and showed it. I was young, but I wasn’t deaf, and I wasn’t so dumb that I didn’t know the difference. I also didn’t realize that my parents were trying to give her as much of what she wanted as they could possibly afford simply because she might not live a long life. They didn’t want to remember that she desired those shoes, or that dress, or anything else, and died before she could enjoy her choice. Therefore, they decided I would never know the difference if they spent more money on her than they did on me. </p><p>Now spending any amount of money was serious business. This was the time when the South felt the terrible weight and helplessness caused by the Depression. It was in the early 1930’s. Homes had been lost, jobs had been lost, investments had been lost. Rich people who lost money, and all their investments had jumped out of tall buildings, shot themselves, or drank themselves to death because they could not face being less than wealthy. But when the big important people lost “everything” a lot of working people, like my Daddy, lost their livelihood too. Not because they were too bold, or too secure that they didn’t see the disaster coming. My Daddy had invested in two houses. He bought them, then allowed them to pay in installments. Our family was sort of “living” on not only my father’s income from his job in a lumber yard, but he was also earning from houses he rented out—the rent was “profit” to my Daddy, and to my grandfather, too. Daddy had also bought two lovely houses, planning to move into one of them after a while, and in the meantime, using the rent money he received to pay the loans on the house. Of course the Depression caused the renters to be unable to pay rent, thus my Dad couldn’t pay the mortgages, and he lost the houses, and everything he had invested into them. . He also lost his job, because he was working for a lumber yard and nobody—but nobody—was building anything. Everybody was scratching to at least keep what they had, if possible. Sadly, it was rarely possible to hold on. There were no jobs. Without jobs, there was no money to spend. With no money no debts could be paid, and thus there were more failures. People who could grow their food on their farms were at least able to eat—if they had seed to plant. Houses could be, literally, given away in some instances, but most folks in this country were flat broke, with no jobs available, and no hope that things would change any time soon. Knowing people, or being kin to people who had farms usually meant you had some food. During that time, and for some years afterward there were people who wandered around towns, and cities, and farms, and anywhere they could beg a meal. Mostly those people were men. They had no “place” and they didn’t have clean clothes. Most had only worn out shoes and little in the way of suitable clothing. In summer they might wear long sleeved outing shirts, simply because they didn’t have any other shirts. In winter, some had only an old sweater, or a threadbare jacket. It seemed strange to me that most of the bums were white. I asked my Dad about that, and he said, the Negro people usually took care of their own. They, he told me, would share. I don’t mean that because they were willing to share with each other they didn’t suffer. They did.</p><p>My Grandfather and my Dad, long years before that time, had purchased some houses already built in an area where only Black people lived. Within Southern cities at that time, there were definite areas where Negroes could live, and other areas where White people lived. The differences were very easy to discern. Most of the black people lived on muddy roads, in dingy old housing without indoor toilets, and with maybe one spigot in the middle of an area where every one got water. The houses were not insulated, and none had a way to warm them except perhaps a fire place or a stove. Their roofs were not always in good repair, and most had an out-house somewhere in the neighborhood—not toilets or bathrooms. It was a miserable sort of life, but they were usually as clean as soap and water could make them, and somewhere near there would be a spigot of running water available. Most of the time the houses were quite close together. This, of course, made very small yards. Therefore, owners could squeeze more small houses in an area. Many white people made money on building houses and renting them to Black people. My father and his father did that. However, my Dad kept the houses he and his father rented out in good repair, and painted them often enough to keep them clean looking. The wife of one of the men that rented one of the houses sometimes did work for us, cleaning the house, washing the clothes, then ironing them when they were dry. That was a period of time that was long away from drip dry clothing, or machines that could dry wet clothes that, when hung up immediately didn’t need ironing. Those days were some years in the future. Almost all cottons had to be ironed before they could be worn. </p><p>Ardie would wash and hang out our clothes to dry, then clean up the kitchen (wipe off the stove, wash the dishes, mop the floor) and if the clothes were dry, she would bring them in, fold the linens, and iron the clothes. My Dad rented one of his houses to Ardie’s family, and helped any of them if he could. And my mother paid Ardie for her work in our house, never cheating her, or short changing her. </p><p>Those days were long before Negroes were recognized as equal to white people. My parents never took advantage of them. When so many people were out of work during the Depression, my parents lived East Fifth Street, one block from a Negro area. There was an old lady named Georgina who lived in that area, and she had no way to heat her house. In the winter my mother invited her to come to our house, because it was warm. Georgina was elderly, but she could and did wash dishes for us, and she helped my mother in other small ways, especially while my sister was so ill. </p><p>didn’t even try to go to school. They would work all day for a meal. themselves.called “bums” who had no home, no food, no jobs, and no hope. ThMost of the time it didn’t turn out to be possible. My Dad lost two houses, partially paid for, and nothing gained from that effort. He lost his job at the lumber yard, and therefore couldn’t even pay the rent on the house he was renting. This was a terrible time for him to lose his job because that was the time when my sister was sick. 1lost “everything” except their lives. It touch</p><p>. Of course, at my age I didn’t realize that was what moved my parents, so I simply thought that I was not “nice” enough to have those things. My sister took better care of her things than I did, therefore she could have nicer things than I was allowed to have. long enough to anything I needed, after all, I was healthy. My sister really needed help and constant care. I was sort of an imposition, no matter where I was. </p><p>Of course, no one, especially my mother, really considered me a nuisance. Not ever did she dislike me, or wish I wasn’t there. She always did her best for me. She made me dresses, I had a new doll each Christmas, she bought me shoes when I needed them, and I never thought I was unloved. I always understood; however, that I was in second place. Ella Cornelia was always first. I was only five years old when that fact was actually proven. . It came about because almost every time I went to see my grandparents, my Uncle Eddieone of my uncles gave me a coin. Mostly it was dimes. That was awesome. There was a filling station practically “next door” to my Grandparents house. My sister was also given a dime, and she promptly went to the filling station and bought a treat. My mother always opened her pocket book and placed my dime into “my” bank, which was “safe” in her purse. I wasn’t one to fret or fuss about decisions since I was told</p><p>I always knew that my sister’s needs, and sometimes her “wants” were more often than not, met. I didn’t understand that my parents thought she might die any day. Her life could be ended by any small illness on top of the sickness that still plagued her. </p><p>However, there was enough of that frequent momentary thought during my sister’s illness that gave me a cue that she was loved more, and was far more valuable than me—simplly because everyone thought she might die young, and therefore, since I had “plenty” of time, she always and had first dibs. I was the baby, but she always got first choice, and no one wanted that to happen. However, if it did, no one wanted a memory of a time when she had to wait for a treat, a new dress, a special item, a pair of shoes, or almost anything that she wished she had, if it was possible, she got that item, if it was at all possible. </p><p>that wasn’t cheaprubbed off on me to make me believe that I was much, much less important than my sister. </p><hr/><p>I know less about my maternal grandparents than I do of my paternal grandparents, simply because my Grandmother Parks died when I was about ten years old, and my Grandfather Parks was killed by a train about two years later. My Grandmother Yandle was an invalid most of my life, and though I saw her often, she was either in bed, or sitting in her rocking chair by a window all the time. I never saw her outside her house except once, when my Dad and Uncle Eddie carried her across her own yard, and a few feet further into her daughter’s house because my Dad was painting her room, and fixing things that weren’t working correctly. She was only out of her house for an afternoon, during which I kept her company. </p><p>I knew less about my Parks Grandparents becauseand my graneight, very young, so that I saw less of them than of my father’s parents. My Yandle grandparents lived until I was very close to adult-hood. paternal grandparents My mother’s parents lived on twhere my mother and her siblings grew up. My mother was the youngest surviving child in her family. Her parents, whose surname was Parks, lived on their own farm near the South Carolina line—not far from Pineville. I think a shopping mall was built on part of the Parks home place. I have very little memory of that home because I was about five years old when I last saw it, and don’t remember much about that house. On the front porch there was a hump-toped trunk, and I do remember that that day it rained, so that I could not go into the yard. I sat on the hump of the trunk, and watched the rain drops bounce on the edge of the porch. I did not realize that inside the house my mother was helping, and planning, a major change in the lives of her parents. My Grandmother Parks, my mother’s mother, had heart trouble, and my Grandfather Parks was old, and found it difficult to run their farm. , except there was a hump-backed trunk on the front porch, and because the grown-ups were talking inside the house, I watched . <strong><em>*</em></strong>*a great number of actually there is a shopping mall, built a little before the year 2,000, which probably covers the farm my grandfather Parks owned. of our Parks grandparents, there was only one uncle who had children, and they lived in Fort Mill, South Carolina. It was easy for them to visit Uncle Dennis’s parents because they lived quite near the South Carolina line. If you are familiar with the geography of Charlotte, you may know where a mall was built on the southern edge of Charlotte—and I think that mall was built either on, or very near where my Grandfather Parks farmed when my mother was young. </p><p>When they visited our Parks grandparents they went to the farmin the Yandle family, and one of only three other grandchildren in the Parks family. Those Parks grandchildren lived in Fort Mill, South Carolina. In those days when they came to North Carolina they visited Uncle Dennis’ parents, my grandparents, who lived on their farm below Pineville. Uncle Dennis drove a 1925 Ford automobile, so his entire family, his wife, Aunt Mary, and their son, Dennis, Jr., and his sisters, Patsy, and Mary Cole. They usually came with him every time he visited his parents, or his sister Ola, and her husband Vance. Those cousins were not a problem to Ella Cornelia. She liked Dennis, Junior, and enjoyed playing with him. . We had only three first cousins, and they lived in Fort Mill. , and only three first cousins.</p><p>My mother had one brother, Dennis, who lived in Fort Mill, worked as a barber (he had his own barber shop) and his wife Mary ran a beauty shop next door to his barber shop. They had children—three of them—one boy and two girls. Her other brother, Luther, married, however had no children. My mother’s sister married a man named Vance Davis, but she was unable to have children. and her other brother did not have children. Of my father’s siblings only one sister was married when I was a child. Aunt Pauline married Henry, however they had no children. Uncle Eddie, Aunt Martha, and Aunt Helen still lived at home with my grandmother and grandfather. Uncle Eddie plowed the fields, planted and harvested every year, and looked after the mule and the cows. Aunt Helen fed the chickens, and Aunt Martha looked after her mother who was an invalid, and blind. , or very near it. when I was small, and she had no children.

If she was married, even at that age, she would no longer belong to her father—she would be a married woman. There was no ban on young marriages, so the boy bought a license, married the girl, and with his earnings rented a house for them to live in. The young husband continued to do a man’s work at the mill. When they married the girl, for the first time in her life, had a little free time. Since she had never “played” in her life, she wanted the experience. When her husband came home to her in the summer, when it was still light, she fed him supper, and then they would go outside, and the girl would draw lines in the dirt, and lay out a “dream” house, and “play like” the lines drawn in the dirt were walls of their home, and then pretend to furnish it with marvelous furniture that was really an down-turned bucket or a tree stump. </strong>***house in the dirt of their back yard, and mark with a line drawn by a stick the rooms of her pretend house.

This young girl went to work in a cotton mill when she was four years old. Her father collected her pay, which was a very small amount. A problem in the cotton mill was the lint that fell on the floors. Therefore, young children could, and did, sweep up the lint. that lint from the Her duty was to sweep up lint from the floor of the mill, which was a problem. whose father was mean—and she was sent to work in a cotton mill when she was four or five years old. She pushed a broom to keep the floor free of lint, and she did it for twelve hours every work day, six days a week. When she grew tired the overseer in charge of the mill would allow her to lean against one of the pillars that held up the roof of the mill, and she could lean back against that pillar and go to sleep standing up. He could not allow her sit down, or lie down—that was against the rules—but he could allow her to rest against a pillar, and he did. That story has an end, and I shall tell it to you now: The girl worked there until she was twelve years old. Another child worked there, too, a boy, who was about fourteen or fifteen years old. He admired that girl child and thought it was not fair that her father would not give her any of the money she earned, not even for shoes. In those days, a child’s pay for any work belonged to his, or her parents. That boy began to pity, and then to love, the little girl. In those days, when a girl married, her father could no longer take from her the money she earned while working. A wife’s money could be used by her husband—but her father could no longer take it. So that young man of about fourteen married the twelve year old girl, and she was free to leave both her parent’s home, and the mill. Her father was more than a little angry because she married so quickly that he had no chance to forbid it. It also meant her father could no longer force her to work, nor take her wages if she did work. He could not demand anything of her any more since she was a married woman—no longer was she his child. </p><p>I, myself, talked with that lady when she was older than my mother by a year or two. She had never actually “played” during her childhood, and she had always wanted to play as other children did. Therefore, after their marriage, in the evenings when her husband came home from work and after they had eaten supper, he agreed to go into the yard with her, and play “house” like other children, especially in the summer when it was still light. She would do, as I did when I was a child. In the back yard where there was no grass, she drew lines in smooth dirt, marking out the rooms of her “house” and making mud pies for the pretended “supper.” They sat on bits of tree stumps, and pretended they were on beautiful stuffed chairs with lovely pillows. </p><p>Playing “House” was something that almost all children did in that day and time. It was a game my mother played when she was very small. My sister, seven years older than I, also played it with her friend, though never with me. I must admit that my sister had a difficult time acknowledging that I was part of the family. A child seven years old—the only child—has every reason to feel special. Then one day my father’s sister, my Aunt Martha who could drive a car, came into Charlotte from Pineville, and scarcely spoke to my sister, already seven years old, and then, without much discussion, left my sister, Ella Cornelia, with a neighbor, not even telling her where they were going, or when they would be back. Ella Cornelia felt as if she had been In addition, though Aunt Martha came back to the house, Mother did not!! Ella Cornelia didn’t know, nor was she told, where mother went, why mother went, or when she would return home. At seven years old, she was frightened and more than a little dismayed by the situation. Then after several days Aunt Martha came back, bringing mother back again, however there was a change: when mother came home, she brought a crying baby girl—tiny little thing—that a lot of who had, all of her life, been of considerable importance, especially to family members. Now, family and friends were eager to see the “little baby”! Therefore, they didn’t pay much attention to Ella Cornelia when they came. Actually, it was a fact that they all sort of ignored Ella Cornelia, but excitedly wanted was to see the “new baby”. The one that cried, and soiled diapers—and that was a bummer, with a capital “B”. One of the worse parts was that Mother seemed to feel sort of weak or not quite well; therefore, Ella Cornelia had to help hand wash that stinky little baby’s nasty diapers and dresses, as our family didn’t have a washing machine. Ella Cornelia desired with all her heart, and for a very long time, that she could talk mother into returning that baby girl to wherever it came from! </p><p>I, myself, loved everybody when I was little—but young though I was, I was wary of my sister, and realized that she did not like me much at all. When Ella Cornelia turned ten years old, I was—give or take a month or two, just about three years old. It was summer, and on a warm day Ella Cornelia played jump rope with a number of friends. </p><p>In that day and time, the game of jump rope could be played as a group game. There were, of course, rules to the game, some of which varied because of the age and gender of the jumpers, or the . The game my sister played was that two or three jumpers would jump at the same time. If a jumper touched the rope, or the rope touched one of them, the girl who was touched was out of the game, leaving the others to continue. Usually only two or three jumpers could jump at the same time because with a larger crowd there was insufficient room to maneuver. , and lots of people would be touched by the rope. . If the rope touched a jumper, she was out, and became a spectator. If it was a group game and three or four people jumped at the beginning of the game, it was the last one who had not been touched by the rope who could “save the day” by jumping ten jumps (while the rope turners would try to vary the rhythm so that it would not be easy) lots of different rules Two people would turn the rope. All the others would be in a group of four or five, and as the rope was turned, the jumpers would jump as a group. Of course it was hard for a large group to jump together, and if the rope touched a jumper, she was out of the game, and became a watcher. The rope turners were usually pretty steady, but were free to change the speed of their turns, making the judging of the rhythm difficult. When the several jumpers were removed, leaving only one member of the “team” still jumping, the jumpers had another chance—because of the last jumper from the game one by one because each had been touched by the rope, it was possible for the team to a jumper had touched the rope,to make the jumping more difficult. did not stop turning If a jumper touched the rope, she was out, and became a watcher while the other members of her team continued to jump. When only one jumper was left, she could try to redeem her group’s chances of entering the game again by jumping alone ten turns of the rope without touching it, but those ten turns could be fast, and difficult to keep up with. If the last jumper actually jumped the ten fast turns of the rope, her team could run in one by one and join her again. The rope did not stop turning so long as one jumper was still jumping, unless the turners were too tired to turn. Usually there were enough when the jumpers began to be tired, they made more mistakes, and when no one could jump the ten redeeming jumps for her team, the rope turners were relieved, and the rope turners changed to former jumpers, and the turners were then free to be jumpers. by When the last jumper was alone, and had(or if) the jumpers returned, If a jumper was touched by the rope, she was out, and she would become one of the turners of the rope, and the others would begin a new game. . y two, or maybe three on a single team. Two would turn the rope. The first “team” of three, or perhaps four, would begin to jump. It didn’t usually take long for at least one person to step on the rope. That person was out. When there was only one person left jumping who had not touched the rope, and that person could jump ten turns of the rope without mishap, her team could join her again, one at a time, by running in to join the one who had jumped ten clean jumps and saved the “team” from taking over the turning of the rope. and jumping without stopping the turning rope to without touching the rope, counting the jumps was important. If the only team member could jump ten turns of the rope without touching it, her entire team was still in the game. </p><p>That meant that if one person could jump ten more perfect jumps she and her team-mates were still in the game. Being tired had something to do with the wrong timing of a jump, but kids with good health and agility could do very well for their team, and that is what my sister did that day. She played ten games, never touched the . It was played like this: one day she played a very active game of jump rope with a group of her friends, probably six or more girls, who divided themselves into two ”sides.” One team turned the rope, and the other group jumped, all at one time. Only two or three could jump at one time. When only one had not failed to jump so that she was touched by the rope, she was “out” of the game. When only one of the team was left, if she jumped ten jumps without touching the rope, her team could return to jump another game, and the rope turners had to keep turning the rope. When all of the jumping a jumper, she was out. If only one “jumper” correctly (it was tiring”, the other side jumped, together. When the rope touched a girl, she had to sit out of the game. That day there was a group of girls playing, divided into two teams. One team turned the rope, and the other team would jump it. Ella Cornelia was an excellent jumper. Her team was the first to jump, while the other team turned the rope—and that meant that all of that team jumped until at least one had touched the rope—and that jumper was “out” of the game, but not permanently. When only one member of a team was left to jump, if that one person could jump successfully ten times, the others could re-join her team, again and the team that was turning the rope had to continue turning the rope. When all the team members were jumping the rope at the same time, it was easy for a jumper to touch the rope. When a jumper touched the rope, she was temporally “out” of the game until only one jumper was left. If that single jumper jumped the rope ten times without touching the fast moving rope, her team of at least three jumpers, could return. If the ‘ten” jumper missed, the other team would become the jumpers, and the loosing team became the rope turners. , and it could be turned fast as a challenge to the single jumper, that team could still ie out of the gameWhen most of the team had touched the rope and only two were left, it was easier for the jumpers to keep right on jumping. When there was only one jumper, if that jumper was able to stay there for ten fast jumps, without touching the rope, her team could enter the game again because that one jumper had jumped ten quick turns of the rope without touching it. However, the one who had jumped ten times had to stay in the group. team could come there were several team members jumping at the same time, it usually didn’t take long for some one to be touched by the rope, but with only one jumper, it was easier tojumpers three jumpers could rejoin her since she had jumped ten times without touching the rope. On that day, Ella Cornelia played ten games. She did not touch the rope—but each time she was left alone, it was she who jumped the extra ten times so that her team mates could re-enter the game. She arrived at home wet with perspiration, and very tired. The next day she was ill. </p><p>Ella Cornelia’s illness occurred well after 1931—the year I was born. I know, because I was I am told I was about three years old when she became ill. Remember that there were no antibiotics. Her illness was so severe four doctors pronounced her incurable—but one insisted she would live, and that was Dear, wonderful, Dr. John R. Ashe.</p><p>Much later in my life my mother told me that </p><p>born in 1931, and I was two or perhaps closer to three when she became ill. Those were the years of the depression, even though the date was a several years past 1929. The depression shattered thousands of lives because when banks failed every person patronizing that bank lost whatever he had put there—whether the deposit was small, minimum, or large, it was gone. If you owed money on a large item like a home, or furniture, and you had paid some fraction of its worth already, the entire balance of its cost remained unpaid, and because banks went broke, whatever you had saved against a rainy day was gone—and, yes, almost every person, business, and bank was affected. Your savings, your bank account, eventually anything that had not been fully paid for, was gone. People were angry, terrified, terribly upset because the bottom of commerce just fell away, and the walls came tumbling down. Businesses didn’t just have a hard time—they crashed along with the banks. have beenwhen the banks failed and you couldn’t retrieve your savings, or even what was in your checking account, with a loan almost anywhere—home, automobile, or business—lost not just the hope of fully owning whatever they were buying, but they lost what they had already invested. If you could not completely pay for your car, house, building, furniture—or any item you had promised to pay for in small increments—were no longer yours, even is you had only a few more payments since you had not completely paid for it. You failed to complete your bargain, and deserved no part of what you had already paid . Bank failures meant there was nothing to borrow. Businesses that had debts lost in the same manner. Banks closed, because they had no money. Businesses could not pay their employees because the banks had closed. People who did not receive their pay checks couldn’t pay their bills, either. Folks who were paying down a mortgage paid, as well as the opportunity to own whatever they were buyinghad his loan called in—pay up or hand over whatever you were buying. most people were out of work when the companies that had hired them collapsed because the companies had borrowed money to expand, and when the cause of the depression was shattering lives and fortunes. Within a few days Ella Cornelia was placed in a hospital (in a time frame when there were no insurance plans to help with illnesses) and she was desperately ill with Pleurisy, along with another illness which affected her heart, had a name I have forgotten. There were four doctors in Charlotte who said she would die because her illness was so severe that she would not recover. Remember that there were at that time no antibiotics. No medicines that could help her. There was, however, one doctor who said, don’t give up—she will live. His name was John Ashe. And he was correct—she did live, though it was a difficult battle, both in expenses and in her struggle to be well again. It did not come easily. She was fragile, restricted to bed rest at first, and later was told not to do some of the things she had earnestly enjoyed. She spent a long time in bed, and a longer time in a wheel chair or on restricted movements. This was the child who loved to dance, and jump rope. This was the active child who had numerous friends with whom she actively joined in physically active games. This was my sister, and I was a true hindrance to her, mostly because I was so young that I needed constant care, at a time when our mother needed to give both diligent and constant care to my sister. </p><p>My memories of that time are few, as I was about three years old. I was talking fairly well. I was told that while my sister was in the hospital, and perhaps the first few days, or even weeks, Ella Cornelia was at home. She needed a great deal of nursing and was not allowed to walk on her own for at least a full year. I was too small to remember the timing—or recall how long I lived with my mother’s sister, Ola. went to live with my mother’s sister, Aunt Ola, and Uncle Vance. And that was a very different environment. My mother’s sister had no children, and lived a couple of miles from Pineville. That meant that she lived about ten miles from Charlotte, in an area that did not have electricity, or running water. She had no children, and had not played nursemaid to very many babies, She and my mother had two brothers who lived in South Carolina, one too far away to be helpful in an emergency. <strong><em>*</em></strong>*although her brother Dennis also had three children. Dennis and his wife Mary lived in Fort Mill, about ten or so miles away from Pineville. In those days automobiles were available, but not everyone had a car. as did Mary’s sister. too. Dennis, his wife Mary, and their three children at that time. Uncle Dennis lived in Fort Mill, one, or possibly two children. She lived out in the country, and at that time the houses in that area had no indoor toilets, nor any electricity, nor did they have running water in the house. All water was carried up a substantial hill from a spring. There were no electric lights, only kerosene lamps. She did not do any household chore exactly as my mother did. She was not my mother. Her husband wore blue overalls, not white ones like my Dad. At night it was dark! In the yard there was a dog. I didn’t like it—and besides she wet my hair, and I truly disliked that! I told her: “you went and wet my hair!” </p><p>If even one of her team mates could jump ten turns of the rope without touching it, her entire team could rein. jumper—and the entire team jumped at one time. When the rope touched one of the jumpers, that person had to drop out. When all except one had been called “out” the one jumper still in the game could jump ten jumps, and her team could return to jump again. leave the team.One team turned the rope and the other team jumped. When all the jumpers save one had touched the rope and been called “out”, the one remaining jumper could, by jumping ten more times without touching the rope, win another try for her team. My swift, athletic sister kept her team “in” the jumping for ten full games, and though her other team members touched the rope and were called “out” she had been the last one still in for her team, and each time she jumped ten times without touching the rope. from jumping, the last jumper could jump ten times, and if there was no miss-step by touching the rope, the entire team could come back in, and jump another turn. Her team game, and each time my sister’s group had only one jumper left in the game it was my sister. Then she jumped alone the required ten jumps that would put her team back </p><p>number of perfect jumps that put her entire team back to jump again, instead of turning the rope.There were lots of girls playing, and it was a group game. They Thereafter Ella Cornelia, in one word, disliked that little interloper, for whom there were times when she had to be quiet, and stop doing what she wanted to do—fun things such as tap dancing, or playing with friends. , or other fun things that suddenly were not acceptable Not only found that girl baby a nuisance, but almost everybody our family visited and </p><p>wasn’t ther where she was, nor why she left home, nor did she know when mother would come back. , or even why, she didn’t come back home. That was, as one would say today, a bummer </p><p>Not only that, Aunt Martha did not bring Mother back home. </p><p>, and my sister, seven years older than me, also played it, though never with me (I was a nuisance to her until I was thirteen). It was simple, and required only a stick of some kind, and bits and pieces of discards from the house, and considerable imagination. It was called “playing house”. Of course, there was no grass in my backyard, except along the bottom edge of a wire fence that separated our yard from the neighbors. We drew rectangles in black dirt, and named them living room and kitchen, and we found things lying around in the nearby yards that could be seats, or tables, or perhaps jar lids that we called plates, and jars that were tumblers for our “tables” that rarely resembled a real one. In my back yard they were often empty up-side-down paint buckets, as my father was a painting contractor. I never had a swing (except on the front porch) or a see-saw that wasn’t “spur of the moment” and not quite satisfactory. I never even had a sand pile until I was close to the age of finding sand piles too “childish”. </p><p>we picked up lines in rectangles along with neighbor children. “Rooms” were laid out and furnished with imagination and the handy bits and pieces of whatever was near to make furniture by me, and all of the girl children I knew while growing up. also played in make-believe rooms, drawn by sticks on bare earth. However, my “chairs” were up-side down empty paint buckets because my father was a painting contractor. The visit by the couple who had married so very young was the only time I ever saw them, but I have remembered them all these years. It was a lesson on how cruel people could be to their own family members, and how blessed I was to belong to my family. I remembered how tenderly he cared for her as they left the house occupied by my grandparents. As they descended the steps he held her elbow, and he didn’t leave her to enter the car alone—he handed her into her seat in the car, closed her door, and then walked to his own side of the car, and climbed into his seat. I thought that was very nice of him. And I believed that it meant he loved her very much. </p><p>That story has a really happy ending. The youth and his child bride settled down to married life, and when he was older he went to school, and eventually became a preacher. She became a good wife, and helped him as he studied, and as he began to preach, and eventually to pastor churches. I met them one Sunday when they visited my blind grandmother, and at that time I was probably about twelve years old, and they were probably in their forties—or perhaps a bit younger or even older. I thought they were both fine looking people, and I was in the room as they were leaving at the end of their visit with my grandmother and the other members of the family, and the preacher paused a moment, and said a prayer, which I thought was a very good prayer—I remember, young though I was, that I approved of him. Though I don’t remember exactly what he said in his prayer, I decided that I would like to hear him preach, since I had learned of his background, but I don’t remember ever seeing them again. Life is like that sometimes. You see and understand a little more about life, and the living of it, but you have only the one chance to take in a lesson, or learn a truth, and it is good if you can remember it, and use it as an experience that is meant to teach you something, because the opportunity is rarely offered a second time. </p><p>There are lots of true stories that are actually entertaining. Of course, not every story is as riveting as the one about the girl who married at twelve years old. I heard that story when I was about twelve, and I met the people at my grandmother’s house. But then, I heard lots of stories about how people lived, loved, and had children who were worthy of admiration. I would like to share some of those events with you.</p><p>There was another part of that story that I learned when I mentioned those folk to my Daddy one evening. He told me that Pineville was a small village in those days—not as large as it was when I was growing up. The father of that twelve year old wife was very angry because of her marriage. He was angry at that boy, because he knew that if he had not married his young daughter she would have had to work in the mill until she was twenty-one years old, and she could not have kept even a penny of her wages until she was twenty-one years old. The man was angry that he could no longer collect her earnings. He had another girl child, named Sophie, who was about eight years old. The father and Sophie were walking down the street in Pineville when he saw a youth walking toward him. The old man yelled out at the child who was with him: “Run, Sophie, run! Here comes another Crump, and if he sees you, he’ll have you and gone with you!” </p><p>I was delighted with the story—the lady had escaped from a “bad” father. However, it taught me that not all fathers were nice—and that probably meant that not all mothers were nice, either. I remember that I was glad my parents were good to me. It told me that I should appreciate them more, and try with honest diligence to make life good for them, as well as myself. </p><p>As years passed, State, and Federal laws prohibited hiring small children for jobs. Even the motion picture makers could not have babies or very young children on sets for hours on end. And sometimes the motion picture makers hired twin babies, so that their camera time with the baby could be doubled. States and our Federal Government passed laws that prevented companies from hiring small children to do a full day’s work. There were age limits that would prevent children who had reached their teen age years from having an job without parental agreement. Furthermore, some part of local stat or city government had to , and the Federal Government made rules about child labor, so that little children could not be hired out at early ages. I don’t remember what the ages were way back then, but when I was growing up, children of less than sixteen could apply for jobs only if they had a special license from the government to do so. It was against the law to keep a child from going to school in order to work at a job. </p><p>, rules were laid out demanding that children could you now. Mng up. North Carolina, and many other states, was becoming strict about the schooling of children because uneducated people were troublesome folk. Therefore the state government had set up rules so that parents were compelled to send their children to school when they reached the age of six years. It was no longer possible for parents to send their small children into a mill to sweep the floors, or to any other duty. Before schooling became a rule, parents could push four or five year old children to work, and that child would have to do whatever he or she was told to do, instead of allowing schooling, or even not schooling children, was not a parental option any more—it was a law. becoming had lots of rules where school was concerned, and when it was time for him to enroll in the first grade, the schools were fairly strict about the ages of the children. First Graders were accepted only if they turned six by a specific date. Past that date by only one day—and the child had to wait until next year to start. </p><p>Well! Loraine Beatty was a petite person, and not just a “female” but was genuinely a lady, as well as a mother. However, she did not want her son to twiddle his thumbs for a year because he lacked a few days of being all of six years old—so she didn’t wait, and he didn’t wait, because she altered his date of birth by about 30 days, and enrolled him in the first grade. </p><p>September was normally the month in which school began, and so little Bobby Beatty enrolled at Dilworth School and began his school career as a student. Destined to finish high school at the end of the twelth school year, Bobby settled into his work in twelve years. Bobby was an intelligent child, and did well at school. He got on well with his teachers, and his school friends, but he did not actually complete his sixth grade classes at that school. When he was about ten years and unexpected event changes a lot of things in his young life. </p><p>Bobby’s paternal grandfather, William Beatty, was a policeman. One Sunday evening Grandfather William Beatty worked late. His wife, Hattie, had been at home most of the day, enjoying fixing a meal and sharing it with their married daughter, Virginia and her husband, Marvin, and their children. Late that afternoon Grandmother Hattie became anxious when her husband didn’t arrive home when he was expected. Grandmother had telephoned his office, but there was no answer. As the evening lengthened, she asked her visiting son-in-law, Marvin, if he would drive down to his father-in-law’s office to see what was delaying him. He had not answered his telephone when his wife had called him, and he was not often this late returning home. When Marvin arrived at Courthouse office, he found his Father-in-law still at his desk, but no longer alive. It was a very sad thing. His wife, and his grown-up children, and their children, were devastated, as were his co-workers. Grandfather Beatty was widely respected by his superiors and his fellow officers on the Police Force, and well loved by his family, his daughter and her husband and their children, and his two sons and their wives and their children. Grandfather Beatty had many friends, and a large family. He was dearly loved, and sadly grieved by many. And his death changed a lot of thing for his family. </p><p>At her husband’s death Grandmother Hattie had to rearrange things in her house to make room for her oldest son’s young family who were moving into her house to help her. The move meant that Paw-paw would have to change schools, and life would certainly be different.</p><p>Hattie Beatty was an older woman—but she was tough just the same. She and her husband had owned their house since early in their marriage. He had been a policeman for years, but he was also an excellent wood-worker, and made furniture in his basement. I still have a table that he gave to his oldest son’s wife, who was my mother-in-law. I have kept that table for more than fifty years, myself, and it is in use in my house now. The house where the Beatty’s lived was large. It was the house their two sons and one daughter had grown up in, and it was a center for all of them, as they were frequent visitors. </p><p>The basement of their house was large and well used because it served as a laundry, a woodworking shop, a storage for home canned foods, a wine cellar, and a play place for numerous grandchildren who visited frequently. On one side of the house was a glassed in place where plants lived in winter, and just outside was a miniature glass </p><p>room, but it was also a wood-working shop, and it served as the space where many of Grandfather Beatty’s projects made. Her husband had been a wood-worker, and had machinery in the basement so that he could make furniture. He was a “man of all work” and stayed busy most of the time he was not working as a policeman for the City of Charlotte. Since the house was located precisely across the street from Lance Packing Company, the famous company that makes those little packages of cheese crackers and potato chips that are still in demand today. Hattie, with the large house just across the street, had taken in boarders who worked for Lance Packing Grandmother Beatty had taken in boarders for years—most of whom were drivers for either Lance Packing, or the street cars that provided public transportation in Charlotte. or the Lance trucks that delivered potato chips and crackers all over the city of Charlotte. nd now that would be difficult, but not impossible, even though her son, his wife, and their little boy were moving in and a great deal would change. Little Bobby was in school, and would have to continue to go school each morning. Some of the regular boarders might have to find other accomodations, and return each afternoon. The house of his grandmother had taken in boarders for years. <br/> routines for sending a child to school from that location. Because Hattie had been in total control of her home for many years, it was difficult, actually close to impossible, for her to ask her daughter-in-law if the recent arrangements made by Hattie were suitable to her. It was hard on Bobby’s mother, too. She was no longer the only mistress of the house she lived in, nor did she now have the “last word” about changes. Despite difficulties, new arrangements eventually became ordinary. If the two ladies were not in total agreement, time rubbed away most of the dismay. </p><p>Changing from one school to another for young Bobby was accomplished, and didn’t seem to bother him. Grandmother Hattie kept on running her boarding house, and Bobby’s mother, took a job uptown in Ivey’s Department Store. </p><p>Life is ever changing, and time kept right on ticking in the house on South Boulevard. The newness of the situation wiped itself off into a matter of routine. By becoming not quite so new due to the passage of time and the true desire to keep peace among all the folk involved, the situation became ordinary, and expected, and the newness sort of wore off in routine. Everyone seemed to slide into the now ordinary and expected every-day routines as time passed. The rough moments smoothed into that routine, and the three generations accepted the changes. </p><p>Bobby had no difficulty changing schools. His mother had not worked outside her house before the move. She had always been at home after school let out. Now she was at work when her son returned from school, and Bobby had a different pattern in his after-school situation. Of course in the summer he enjoyed a real bonus when his three cousins came with their mother (his Aunt Virginia) to visit Nan-naw, which is what all the children called his Grandmother. Bobby’s uncle Erskine lived near by, also, but his only child was a quite young little girl, so the boys didn’t see her as often as they saw each other. </p><p>Another new adventure was Bobby’s discovery of the Boy Scouts. There was a Boy Scout troop meeting in a church not far from his grandmother’s home. He joined the troop, and began to earn badges. He doesn’t remember exactly how old he was when he ventured into the Boy Scout experience. He does remember that the group met in a nearby church, and he was encouraged to earn badges for specific accomplishments as a Scout. Scouts were expected to “earn” badges to sew on their uniforms. Among the challenging projects that ended with a badge to display was a long hike of fourteen miles—that is, seven miles away from the starting point, and seven miles back. Bobby wanted to earn that badge. However, he had no fellow scout to share his hike. Of course his mother didn’t want him to walk fourteen miles alone. In fact, she said no! Not alone! When there didn’t seem to be any one who could conveniently accompany him on his hike his mother did what most mothers would have done—she herself went with him, walking seven miles away from home base, and seven miles—each and every one of them—all the way back home. In due time, Paw-paw received his Boy Scout Badge for a fourteen mile hike. <br/> Paw-paw enjoyed Boy Scouts, and when he was about twelve he went on a Boy Scout camping trip. But when he changed schools the next fall, he joined the school band, and doesn’t remember going to scout meetings after that. </p><p>Time, people, animals, and cities, no matter how beautiful The City of Charlotte found itself growing. Some of the older school buildings were growing so old they were no longer totally safe for use. One of those buildings was a school with a grand name: Alexander Graham School, with a grand location just off </p><p>was close to the great Catawba River, and from early childhood Paw-Paw and his parents, and lots of other family members often went to the river for a refreshing weekend. however, when he started to Junior High School he didn’t attend the meetings he decided, while still in grammar school, that he wanted to play the cornet—sometimes call a trumpet—and between the ending of his sixth grade class and the beginning of the seventh grade he took lessons throughout the summer so that he could play cornet in the band. When school began in September he attended his first Band practice, and was quite disappointed when his director announced that the band already had all the cornets it needed. What , and when school started he joined the band. Things did not work out exactly how he planned it, though, because when school he thought about playing an instrument in the school band. He wanted to play a cornet, and wanted to take music. When he left the Sixth Grade, and was changing from </p><p>Across town, while Pawpaw was growing up, riding his bike to school, and riding it back home again. When he entered While he was delivering newspapers everyday, and attending school, the rest of the world became restless, with events occurring in other countries that were not only troubling, but downright frightening. </p><p>The citizens of the United States, for the most part, spoke English, though many people could speak more than one language because their parents, or their grandparents who had come to this country in the early 1900’s, still spoke the language of their European childhood, even if they also spoke English. It was usual that people who spoke the same languages would dwell close together if possible, and in many of the larger cities there would be sections in which at least two languages were spoken. The older folk usually treasured the language they grew up with, and couldn’t discard it. The younger ones became fluent in both languages, and used English at school, and with neighbors, but at home spoke the language of their grandparents. </p><p>In today’s world, especially in the United States, almost everyone has at least one television set, and I can tell you that in my house there are three—our private TV located in our sitting room, the larger family one in the living room, and another private one in Jessica’s bedroom, that received only local stations. </p><p>The living room T.V. set is used almost exclusively by Jessica and Matthew, or their five siblings who live just across the street. Of course there is a TV across the street, too, but often there is a conflict of interest in the available broadcasts, that means either one or more of the children are disappointed in the choice of stations. Therefore, they often visit us—or rather our living room television—especially when there is a difference of opinion about which of the available programs will be watched at home. <strong><em>*</em></strong>When father, mother, or other siblings wish view a particular program then difficulties arise when it is discovered that someone else has first choice, and when it is time for some other broadcast that is dear to another member of the family. when someone (like a Mother or a Daddy) insists on watching a specific program when one other person (or maybe a bunch of other persons) desire to watch a different station. want to watch something else. </p><p>Jessica and Matthew have private rooms, but both are small, with little room to spare once there is a bed, a chair and perhaps a table or desk in the room. When the young people invite company, or just want to relax, they use the nicely furnished living room that has two sofas, lamp tables, a coffee table, a piano and a couple of unusual chairs that have seats and backs, but no legs. The floor chairs are great for playing video games since they can be used quite close to the screen of the TV. The leg-less chairs place the sitting person about six inches off the floor, just opposite the TV screen, and within easy reach of the controls for the game. The padded backs of the strange close-to-the-floor rockers are sturdy and comfortable, and the controls for the game easily are easily used. </p><p>The large living room is open to the dining room—actually not a separate room, but a separate area at one end of the kitchen. Our table is not far from the threshold, and will seat eight people if they are good friends. If any of the people are touchy about being too close to each other, the table will seat only six folks. The kitchen is wonderful, with sink, counters, pantry, lots of shelf space for dishes, and in the middle, a large work table that has storage space beneath it. In one corner of the kitchen is a small pantry with lots of shelves. Cabinets with doors line the walls of the kitchen. Most of the living room opens into the dining room/kitchen area. I love the kitchen-dining room set-up. The eating area is visible from the living room, and in the wall beyond the table is a double sliding door overlooking our back yard, letting in light and sunshine and the vision of a stand of forest—not especially planted for our enjoyment—but an untamed forest of various trees, that have lived not very far from a lake for long years. A little of the forest is on our land, and was not removed when the house was being built. Between our house and the lake there are unsold lots, a road, and an embankment that surrounds a huge lake—the one that supplies water to a very large area. The lake has water, fish, and banks—with a few small animals that frequent lake-sides. Fishing is allowed, but no boats of any sort. </p><p>Our house is not actually on the lake, but since there are no houses on the road that runs between us and the lake we can see the lake surface during the winter when the trees have no leaves. In summer the view is of green leafed trees that any slight wind turns into a moving, swaying wall of differently shaped trees, and nearer to us, honeysuckle and vines that that blend in with the leafy trees to produce a massive wall of natural beauty. In winter, we can see snatches of the lake between the bare branches. </p><p>Can you believe that when Paw-paw and I were young there was no—absolutely no—television? Some folks had radio. Our family had one because one Christmas Daddy bought one as a family Christmas present. During the day, and for the most part, during the work week, the radio sat on the kitchen table. Sometimes on Sunday we moved it into the living room. Then one summer day when I was about twelve years old, Daddy had an opportunity to buy another radio, which took its place in our living room. It took up lots of room, and was a wonderful machine because, in order to hear records, we didn’t have to wind up a turntable with a crank. The click of a knob turned on the radio, which could pick-up broadcasts from several local stations, and a few distant ones. If you owned a record either ten or twelve inches in diameter, you could place a it on a turn table with an upright spike through the hole in its center, and listen to the music etched on the ten inch, or twelve inch, disc. The discs were called records. Our marvelous player had an automatic device could drop a stack of records on the turntable and play them one by one, without having to manually change the disc. Awesome!</p><p>There were four or five movie houses in the up-town area, and to my complete surprise, one day we drove on a busy road near Presbyterian Hospital, and discovered that a new movie theater had been built along the street. There were several buildings in the area, and most of them had doctor’s offices in them. Then smack dab in the middle of all those serious buildings was a fun thing—a motion picture theatre. It stayed there for years, and may be there yet—however I don’t live in Charlotte any more, and I don’t know. </p><p>There had always been grocery stores, and drug stores close to areas where there were homes. Most of the department stores were “up town” in the business center. Charlotte, when it began to grow, and houtime the stores were drugstores built near small grocery stores, or other convenient shops. malls, though they had not yet come to be call “malls” as the shops were usually small and limited in their products. a couple on heavily traveled streets well traveled streets There had been movies in theaters for a long time—at least it seemed long to me. for, and movies that were shown in theaters; but not television. Television may have already been a hope or dream in someone’s mind, but it was not in the market, nor was it talked about in the early years of World War II. Radio was useful to soldiers who used that medium to stay in contact with leaders, especially when troops were stretched out over a wide area, and certainly when enemy soldiers were near any part of their location. Scientists in both America and the countries we were fighting were working on ways to intercept messages, and methods to secretly provide information to their armies without the enemy intercepting the same information. Civilians, adults and children alike, were considered much less important than soldiers. There were shortages of food in grocery stores, shortages of clothing and shoes in department stores, shortages of automobiles and trucks for ordinary businesses, and shortages of doctors and nurses because they were on the front lines of the war. There were shortages of people to work in offices, and sometime churches had no pastor because their preacher had enrolled in the military to serve as chaplain wherever he was needed—on army training bases, or with fighting men on the battleground. </p><p>Fruits and vegetables that had once been canned began to appear in jars—much more fragile than cans. However, metal was scarce because vehicles and guns and planes were being produced, therefore ordinary items were simply not manufactured because of the lack of supplies. </p><p>People were scarce, too. Many manufactured items were necessary to the war effort, and if they were necessary for the ordinary home use of civilians, they quickly became scarce and hard to find. Since the government had first choice on all items, the civilians began to suffer from lack. Ladies could not buy the stockings they liked best, clothing of all sorts was hard to find, especially shoes. Men in important necessary jobs were drafted into the military, and there were no others men available to take their places. </p><p>Until that time women rarely worked outside the home except in a few cotton mills, or perhaps in a department store, or doing what women had always done, care for the sick as a hospital nurse, or perhaps some other acceptable, lady-like occupation. That factor changed quickly. Women began to step into offices, banks, stores of all kinds, and when the need arose, into factories where before the war began only men had been hired. Women learned to drive, as soon as their father’s or brothers, or husbands went into service. Women began to clerk in grocery stores, in department stores, in restaurants, and most important of all, in factories making war materials like guns, airplanes, boats, ships, and cars. Gender no longer mattered, because Many factories had to build a new room or two because now they needed restrooms for women, too. </p><p>Young girls past their sixteenth or seventeenth birthdays went to work in hospitals as Nurses Aids. That title was, to my knowledge, brand new. <strong><em>*</em></strong></p><p>, women stepped into jobs formerly always filled by men. The sudden change in the gender of workers was extremely notable. Women appeared in offices, yes—but also in factories, in hospitals, in stores, in areas where women had never before worked. Ladies who were far too feminine and delicate to do anything outside their homes, were suddenly working in factories, in offices, in areas that would have caused a “scandal” had the need been less prominent A popular song in those days was about Rosie, the riveter, who, though dainty and feminine, worked right in the factory with the strong and rough men who riveted war tanks and war ships together for use during the war. With so many men, and some women going into the army open left many important jobs without workers, and the demand for workers made gender walls tumble down, and women began taking jobs only men had sought before the war. </p><p>. opportunities , or doctors, nurses, and preachers volunteering to accompany the into and iron and steel Children my age sometimes were drafted to do necessary, but simple chores that helped civilians—such as placing a stamp in ration books so that the person who received that ration book could buy gasoline for a car or truck, or food for family or himself. I think I must have rubber stamped a thousand ration stamp books in one afternoon when a large number of students from my age to twelfth graders. We had all volunteered to help the leaders of the City of Charlotte because beginning on a certain date no one could buy meat, canned foods, and scarce food-stuffs and some clothing without a “stamp” which was about the same size of a postal stamp. The book of stamps was about the size of a dollar bill, and was made of paper much like that which newspapers were printed on, but closely resembling the shape and size of a book of </p><p>postage stamps, with little perforations so that they could be easily torn out of the book along with money to buy things that were in short supply—such as meat for the table, and shoes, and gasoline for automobiles. Hording was frowned on, and boot-legging the rationed items were punishable. . that was printed on paper that looked like newspaper sheets, and were easily torn. Upon a certain day in the near future stores and gasoline stations could not sell certain items without a stamp as well as the cost of the item. and needed help to rubber stamp one ration booklet with little stamps that could be torn out. Every person, infant to elderly, needed a book of stamps to buy items that were in short supply—like canned goods, gasoline, shoes, and other necessary items. Each person living in Charlotte, no matter how old or how young, had to have one of those stamp booklets. My memory of what they were used for is a little dim, but gasoline was rationed, meats and other canned foods, and some clothing as well, particularly shoes. other foods were rationed, as were shoes. These items could not be bought without a ration ticket. There was a great number of ordinary items, such as canned goods, and meats, that were sold only when the buyer had not only money, but also ration tickets. There was an old joke that had made the rounds in Charlotte while I was very young, and the punch line from that ancient joke began to be a by-word. The joke was about a Chinese laundry which I can’t remember, and I can’t remember the funny part, but the gag line was something about a Chinese man in a laundry who refused to release a man’s clean shirts by saying, “No tickee, No shirty” that</p><p>leaders at a huge auditorium in Charlotte. The auditorium was used for a large variety of productions: wrestling matches, orchestra concerts, a production of Handel’s “Messiah” by a traveling choir, occasional operas, exciting teams playing special basket ball games, dances when the expected crowd was large, and even lectures by well known speakers or a series city-wide worship with publicly well-preachers. city-wide worship Christian presentation by one or more famous preachers, or a local production of Handel’s Messiah. </p><p><strong>*</strong>888888</p><p>were held, and an occasional concert, as well as city-wide worship services, or the presentation of operas that were presented by traveling musicians. held on specific specials, n, or some other such as me at that time helped. went to a large building —and one of my memories of that period of </p><p>hospitals, stores, and lots of other ordinary things that could not be done So much so that soldiers got food, shoes, tents, bedding, uniforms, motorized machines and ammunition and other supplies even if the civilian population was not supplied with shoes, clothing, some foods, or trucks and cars.

Suddenly, physicians were scarce ose Doctors who remained in their practices were often overwhelmed with “new” patients. e doctors who stayed home were inundated with new patients whose were </p><p>For the duration of the war there was an array of items that could not easily be bought, for any amount of money. One thing was automobiles, which were not being manufactured at all for civilians (that means any and every one who was not attached to the armed services) no matter what their age. Foods from other nations were either no longer sold, or in short supply, such as sugar, bananas, or other items no grown in the United States. Meat was sometimes not available because a great amount of meat, either already butchered or still on the hoof was being changed into meals for people who recently joined the armed services. Among the items that were in short supply was sugar, at that time coming mostly from Cuba. Then there were other items such as coffee, tropical fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, pork beef, fish, even cigarettes, were in short supply for civilians. , or any other fruit, vegetable, or meat Americans had been buying outside the country. not being manufactured, or bought from other nations are these: Stockings leather shoes men’s apparel sugar including shoes, stockings, some clothing that required elastic, many foods imported or shipped across country, , many foods, especially sugar, which mostly came from Cuba, and many other items. Winter clothing Where clothing was concerned, shoes were scarce, and for the most part, only rayon stockings (for females) were available—no longer could ladies get silk stockings from China. Rayon stockings were disliked because they twisted and wrinkled easily. New clothing was hard to find—that is—the kind of clothing you wanted was usually in short supply. Shoes were a problem. Why all the shortages? Suddenly—really suddenly—an army of thousands had been inducted into the armed services, and <strong>*</strong>*A huge army of men for whom there were no uniforms or standard boots had to be clothed. the same problem with shoes, they were scarce, too. Sweaters were hard to find, and women with nimble fingers found knitting them was easier than trying to find colors and styles that suited them. Food—yes, food, was scarce. Most of the reasons had to do with transportation, or the source of the product. Items that came from Europe or South America or even all the way across America (from California when you lived on the Atlantic Coast) could be blamed on lack of transportation. Transportation was busier than it had ever been; however, any chore needed by the military came first—and civilian shipments were usually carried when it was convenient to do so. </p><p>Shoes were scarce because available leather was being used for footwear for the armed services. Radios were hard to find in stores because airplanes, ships, and armed services had first dibs on radios. Because of the war ordinary citizens who had no radios wanted to buy one, and those who had only a large radio that was difficult to shift from room to room, wanted a portable. This was not selfish. In winter most homes were still using stoves and fire places for warmth. There were many that had furnaces that could heat an entire house—but fuel—from wood to special coal, was scarce. The men-folk who cut the wood were in service, coal was very scarce, and oil, which came across the sea, was rationed. Most families, mine included, closed off most of the rooms, and used only their kitchen, if it could serve as a sitting room, too. That’s what my family did. Instead of the living room’s comfortable stuffed furniture, our family sat on kitchen chairs near the stove, and didn’t complain. Currently housing is built with open areas instead of actual separate rooms. It would be difficult to hole up in one smaller place in those houses. We didn’t have that problem in the 1940’s. Presently homes , most houses have more than one TV in a house. **** Television</p><p>in almost every home. But if you wanted to wee but if you wanted to see a something that seemed real, you had to go to the movies. Long before television became available to homes, Radios were the source of news, entertainment, music of various kinds, comedies, dramas, and programs called “soap” operas. a no for nonelong, long, before Television appeared. Radios were handy, but many homes were dependent on newspapers for daily information and news. Because Bobby’s Grandfather sold newspapers uptown on the northwest corner of the square, he enjoyed helping him to sell newspapers and magazines. When Bobby could manage it, he would help his Grandfather as tenants of the nearby buildings stopped to pick up their evening papers. The Ivey’s store was known for its elegance, and as a fact they did have quite beautiful clothing, but Ivey’s was not a store that bragged about low prices. Since Bobby’s mother worked there she usually bought her clothes there, too, as she got a small discount. Sometimes my mother looked at their clothes, then made me a dress that looked a lot like the ones on the Ivey’s racks. The store where his Mother worked was one block away, and then the two of them would go home together. helped him sell papers as often as he could. Sometimes he sold papers until time to meet his Mother When it was time for the stores to close <strong><em>*</em>*8888</strong>** Sometimes he He also walked to Ivey’s to meet his mother and go home with her. occasionally offered his grandfather help with selling the papers. he had heard a lot about selling newspapers. And as he grew older and more confident walking to school, he often walked to the business district of Charlotte, which most people simply called “up town”. His mother was working about a block from the square at Ivey’s and she left work around 5:00. If Bobby was early for his mother to leave work, he often stopped at the kiosk from which his Grandfather Beatty sold newspapers and magazines. Sometimes he helped his grandfather sell the papers before he walked a block down the street to meet his mother who was leaving the store at closing time. . y, and our country. Events that were newsworthy from Europe and Africa were mentioned if they were significant. There was another way to hear news, however. Radios had been in use for some years, but in Charlotte most people could not afford to buy radios, and they were extremely cautious about using electricity when it wasn’t absolutely necessary. There were two radio broadcasting stations in Charlotte: WBT and WSOC. WBT was first, and that company built a tall tower that was visible from a stretch of Pineville Road a little distant south of Charlotte. The road itself passed close to the small city of Pineville, through which both the railroad and a highway passed. When my Dad drove down Pineville Road to visit his parents or my mother’s sister, we watched for that tall tower which had little red lights on it that blinked off and on all day, as well as all night. Some years later WBT erected two other towers so that there are three of them, now. Radios were a new and quite marvelous thing, but they were not free. If you bought a radio, and could pay for the electricity it took to listen to it, you could hear everything WBT broadcasted, from about 6:00 AM to about 11:00 PM, when they stopped broadcasting. Because everybody with a daytime job went to bed by 11:00 o’clock, there was no one awake to listen to the radio, so there was no reason to keep on broadcasting.</p><p>Since the Depression was still affecting what people bought and also how much electricity they used, most people did not yet own a radio, simply because they could not afford to buy one. Sometimes people who owned a radio would invite neighbors to visit just for their pleasure of listening to the entertainment, or the news the radio could provide. Another reason folks did not buy a radio, was that it used electricity. Most people who had electricity were careful how many, and how often, lights were turned on in their houses. If you were alone in a room, and left the room for more that a minute, you clicked off the light to save the cost of electric power. North Carolina, as well as most of the nation, was still recuperating from the Depression in the early 1940’s. I was very young when the Depression struck our country. Studying history in school was required, but I never clearly understood why everybody went broke at one time. I was absolutely certain that it had happened, because my parents told me that Daddy was buying three houses as an investment. Since he couldn’t make the expected payment because he lost his job, he lost those houses, and didn’t get any of his money back. Without a job, he did not get paid. He lost his job because his boss couldn’t pay him anymore since his business wasn’t making any money. However it happened. My Dad lost his job because his boss couldn’t pay him for his work. Companies couldn’t pay workers because the people who had not been paid couldn’t buy whatever the company produced, so since nobody was buying, the companies didn’t make any money. The banks, which should have been rich because people had given them money for safe keeping, either didn’t have any, or not enough, of money when people tried to withdraw it. The banks closed, and no one made deposits any more. the banks which kept their money had lost it. Since Companies could not get their money out of banks, people did not get paid. Because people weren’t paid they couldn’t pay their rent or buy groceries. When people could not pay rent or their loans on their houses, they had to leave their homes. Bosses couldn’t pay workers. Workers couldn’t buy food or pay liens because their bosses couldn’t </p><p>n to the people who had deposited it. I studied history, but I have never really been able to reason out why there was suddenly no dispense to people who had money. Most of the banks in the United States suddenly had no actual money. was caused by the failure of almost every bank in the country. The losses that followed the failure of banks caused great hardships in the United States. When banks closed, companies could not pay their workers. Workers who didn’t get paid for their work, and could not remove their savings from a closed bank could not buy food, or pay their debts. provide sor who had lost their jobs because their workplace had simply closed, had no money to pay for food, housing, or medical care.

People who were buying homes could not sell them, as no one had money to buy them and the banks could not offer a loan. continue to pay each month, and lost their homes—they couldn’t sell their homes to retrieve their investment in it, as no one had the money to pay for it. People lost their equity in the house because they had no money to continue paying their loan. to recoop because no one had money—and so they lost what was already invested in their homes. Because they could not make regular payments they were evicted from their homes. Many businesses failed simply because no one had money to buy their products.

People really did go hungry, and if they were sick, they really couldn’t buy medicine. .

Farms and the lack of money and jobs caused by the depression, and people sometimes went without shelter or food. I can remember vividly that there were “bums” in our neighborhood. Bums could usually find some sort of shelter near railroad tracks, mostly because ordinary people within the city tried diligently to avoid the noise of the trains which were compelled to blow whistles each time the railroad crossed a city street. Since traffic rolled on the streets day and night, there was no time the city was without train whistles for any length of time. If the trains did not howl, the mills did. to warn traffic to get off the rails where streets crossed the tracks. or roads crossefor the were laid through the city there was often a section of housing that could not shut out train whistles, nor could they avoid knocks on their back doors from bums.

Grandmother Beatty kept right on making lunches for the people who worked for Lance Packing Company, and Bobby Beatty changed schools, and settled down in his new situation. Living there, he did get to see his cousins a little more often than previously. His Aunt Virginia had three sons, one a bit older, the others younger than young Bobby Beatty. He now saw his cousins more often. </p><p>y family moved into Grandmother Beatty’s house. The recently widowed Hattie had taken in “boarders” for </p><p>many years. Right across the street was a Lance Packing Company. This was the manufacturer of snacks such as plain as well as cheesy crackers spread with peanut butter and wrapped in small packages for nibbling at lunch. That company also made potato chips in small bags that were favorites of young students who carried lunch bags to school—or grown up folks who lunched on sandwiches and apples at mid-day. These items were vended from behind counters, and also from machines that, when fed nickels or dimes, would release tasty crackers or chips for hungry folk. Trucks bearing the Lance logo drove to countless spots within Charlotte where machines tucked in corners of hallways and basements were a relief to busy workers, students, or unprepared visitors who were hungry, with no restaurant nearby. Each Christmas the Lance Company put up lights and scenes of Santa and a manger in a stable scene with loud music that included carols and happy songs about the Christ Child, as well as Santa. Lance made the display interesting enough that families with small children usually had to pass the scene more than once before their small children were satisfied that they had not missed any part of the display. Lance used easily recognized trucks driven usually by young men who faithfully delivered snacks to snack bars as well as wonderful modern machines which, when fed a nickel, would push out crackers or chips. Now that—my friends—that was a marvel. There had never before been such a thing—a machine that, for a nickel, would slide out a package of crackers. That was amazing!</p><p>The young men who kept the vending machines filled with Lance products, and delivered their products to vendors—small, large, and in-between hired young men to drive their trucks, refilling vending machines and re-stocking shelves at all the large and small outlets where the product was sold. Many of those young men were single, and actually from out of town. They would spend Monday through Saturday delivering snacks on a specific route, go home on Saturday evening, and return on Monday morning. </p><p>In those earliest days of public transportation trains were sometimes a mixed chain of passenger and freight cars. As railroads grew more plentiful, and movement of both goods and people became more frequent, trains in the West, as well as in the East, tended to be either passenger or freight, but not actually both. The use of automobiles increased fairly rapidly when they were introduced all over the country. At first only the daring that were also wealthy drove an automobile. The usefulness of horseless carriages was immediately visible. It was easier to pour gasoline into a tank than to water, feed, and shelter several horses—and automobiles did not require cleaning the smelly floor of the garage as horse barns did. Automobiles were introduced early in the twentieth century, and there were a few used in the previous century. However, in the early days of Charlotte, petroleum products were not available in large quantities in most areas of the United States, and the majority of the roads that connected cities distant from each other were still unpaved and rough. Even within towns pavement was not usual. For instance, in early days the center of Charlotte where Trade Street crossed Tryon Street, and which was called the Square, could be approached on fairly level ground from the north, south, and west, however, the eastern approach of Trade Street was a steep hill, and when it rained, slippery mud was a problem for heavily loaded wagons and for automobiles. Busy streets where horse-drawn traffic was heavy were usually quite nasty to walk across in either rain or sunshine. </p><p>In the early 1900’s the streets in the South, including the city of Charlotte, were often simply dirt roads, which turned to mud and slush on rainy days, making all transportation difficult. Cement was a wonderful invention, as was asphalt. I know that not all of Charlotte’s streets were paved when I was a child, because I saw them. My parents first lived on East Fifth Street Our first home was a rental on East Fifth StreetMy parents first lived on East Fifth Street, but then moved to West Eleventh Street when I was about three years old. I have only tiny fragments of memories of the Fifth Street house, but memories of Eleventh Street are vivid. d with my family on West Eleventh Street until I was married. I witnessed many changes in the uptown of Charlotte, as we lived less than as they occurred on that street. Most of the streets I was familiar with were black-tops. We lived on West Eleventh Street which Of course most of the streets were paved by the time I was ten, but there were still new areas being opened up, and . Occasionally brick or stone would cover heavily used streets. Many towns along rivers or the sea , and along the coasts would arrive empty to take on ship-loads of goods to be delivered elsewhere. , and this was very true of towns all over our country. Towns and cities near the sea, or along deep rivers where ocean going ships travel, sometimes had one small advantage where road-building was concerned. Sailing ships without When sailing ships emptied their holds they hoped to find rarely returned left their anchorage empty—but them turned around to return home without loading their holds reached their designation and emptied their holds, they could not go to sea again without ballast—a fancy name that meant in most instances, heavy rocks. abt</p><p>or near a river. Ships which had delivered the products they had transported could not simply sail away empty, with no weights in the hull, lest they overturn. Upon occasion they off-loaded the necessary rock ballast materials in their hull in order to replace them with shipping crates. Towns made quick use of them by using the ballast stones to pave roads—thus cobble stone streets were born. Cement was used more often, and a little later Tar became the less expensive covering for muddy streets and roads. Because I was so very young when automobiles became the norm rather than a sensational rarity, I don’t remember when paved streets came to be expected rather a happy surprise in Charlotte. I know—because I walked them—that there were still unpaved streets in Charlotte when I was a teenager. At that time, especially in the South, most cities were divided into “sections”. There was “up-town” which was usually the business and shopping district, and “Mid-town” which often was a business area, with stores, offices, and sometimes government, buildings. Then there were areas where the very poor whites or the Negro people lived. Shamefully, people with money to invest would build poorly put together dwellings, most of which did not have piped water (thence no bathrooms and no water in the kitchen). In most of those neighborhoods there would be one spigot on a pipe somewhere in the area where water could be drawn into cups or buckets. The unbeautiful and sometimes pitiful area where colored people lived rarely had pavement, and in some places there was still a water pipe—the only source of clean water—at the intersections within that neighborhood. I know, because I saw it, and knew Negro people who lived in such a place. I was too young to know why or how we knew them, but we did know the Mason family, Ardie and her husband Gary, and most of their children, and eventually a few of their grand-children. </p><p>I remember hearing about another black lady who helped my mother during a time when I was very small, and my sister was not expected to live. Her name was Georgiana. I’ve been told that I loved and trusted her, and that she took care of me when I was an infant—in exchange for a warm place to be in the winter, and at least one meal each day. My mother did not take advantage of her situation to get work without pay—Georgiana had no way to heat her house and it was winter. She was short of food, and we fed her. She was elderly, and she could sit down when she was weary. She lived very close to our house on East Fifth Street. It was in a period of hardship for nearly everyone during the depression. I have little or no real memory of that time. I do know that my Daddy lost his job at a lumber yard because no one was buying lumber, and few had the money to build anything. </p><p>This was a time of which I have almost no real memory. The crash of Wall Street didn’t actually bother our family, and we had no large deposits in Wall Street. However, when Wall Street failed, businesses began to shut down, and rich people became quite poor. People who were in debt, or buying anything (automobiles, houses, furniture, or such) they suddenly had no jobs, no money, and not much hope that even nominal jobs would be available any time soon. People who had lost their jobs or their homes were devastated—which doesn’t mean they were just upset! Devastated means they were forced to leave the homes on which a mortgage was owed –and it was pitiful, but true that anything they had paid into the cost of houses, automobiles, furniture, and such, was now lost. The lien holders did not give back that portion which was paid. Lost was a heavy word. Lost meant all gone. Almost paid didn’t matter. </p><p>Lenders who were even briefly “merciful” to debtors were losers, too. </p><p>My Daddy was working for a lumber store, and invested in buying two houses, rented them out, and used the rent to pay installment on the houses. When tenants lost their jobs, they couldn’t pay rent to my Daddy, resulting in his inability to make payments on the lien against the houses he was buying as an investment. Therefore he lost not only the property, but the entire amount he had invested in them. With so many empty houses available, no one needed building materials, causing the Lumber yard where he worked to fail, and he no longer had a job. </p><p>Investors stopped building houses because there were lots of vacant ones abandoned when people couldn’t pay their rent. Jobs all over the country disappeared when businesses failed. The lumber yard couldn’t sell its lumber, as no one was building anything. Any person who had a debt found it difficult or impossible to actually pay it. Banks failed, and those who had placed money in failed banks bank to peopl. Some housing that had only begun to be built was abandoned because the owner could not complete the job, nor sell it unfinished. Mr. Hodges’ lumber yard was losing money because housing could not be completed and sold. —and the wood would not be paid for because the house couldn’t be sold. were vacant because would-be owners couldn’t keep up the payments, but there was no money to build brand new houses, either. people couldn’t Not only those belonging to folk who could no longer make payments on either the houses they were buying, nor the ones they were renting</p><p>houses. as no one was building houses he eventually lost his job because the owner was not able to sell his product. . of. As an adult I was told that my parents were living with my Dad’s Aunt Lizzie on East Fifth Street, and when the Depression The business where he worked eventually went broke. a time of which I have no real memory. I do remember very little about her, except that I trusted her, and she was often in our house. Georgiana was elderly. She and , and had neither food, coal, or wood in her house. She was both cold and hungry, and my mother invited her to our house. During that year and for several years later, my sister was not well. She had suffered an illness that included pleurisy and fever, and three our doctors in Charlotte saiShe would help mother who was trying to keep my sister alive, and keep me from getting sick during that winter. I was probably two or three years old the summer and winter of the last year we were on Fifth Street—probably 1934. During that time, my sister, Ella Cornelia, was very ill. She was in Presbyterian Hospital, had at least four doctors who were trying to keep her alive. My parents were warned that she would probably die, and that if she did, it might be a blessing. </p><p>She came to our house to help my mother, especially when my sister was born, and again when I was born. </p><p>muddy when it rained, poor, in some with a shas barns did. much cleaner, too. available in the early 1920’s, were in use, of course, but young people rarely owned one, and most families who could afford an automobile had one. Strangely, in most places there were not many women drivers. I can remember that I was actually shocked when the lady across the street from us learned to drive, and would drive away from her house with complete ease. My surprise was that she could find herself back at home, because a person could get lost on unfamiliar streets. </p><p>—not one for each driver—but one for the family. It was usually the father who used the automobile, and the rest of the family walked or rode the bus. I, myself, walked more than a mile every school day to the high school I attended, as did my sister before me. When I enrolled at Queens Collage the distance was too great for walking, and I rode a city bus about five or so miles across Charlotte every school day. </p><p>. The could go home to spend Sunday with their families. They needed a bed to sleep in during the week, and hat meant they had to have a place to sleep during the week. Many people who had an extra room would rent it out to <strong><em>*</em></strong> and lots of those young men were not married, but they also did not have family in Charlotte. Therefore, they needed a place to eat and sleep during the week while they were working for Lance Packing Company. In those days, there were lots of boarding houses. </p><p>A boarding house was an ordinary house, which had extra bedrooms, and some member of the family who could cook at least two meals, but more often three meals each weekday. These homes were called boarding houses. They were ordinary homes that were </p><p>Working people who didn’t have a house, or apartment could usually search for and find a home where there was an extra room, or several extra rooms, where the boarder could live, and eat two, or more likely three, meals each day.

A few, if they worked near their boarding house, could go there and eat lunch, too. </p><p>for boarders, usually went home on the week-end, these were unmarried men for the most part, who worked for Lance Packing Company, and were not married. It was quite usual from time to time, allowed some of the young, unmarried men who drove trucks for There were still a one or two ver Beatty, along with his wife and ten year old son, Bobby Beatty, moved into the house with her. Life is always changing, and Robert E. Beatty (Paw-paw) saw a lot of changes. He now attended a different school. He had fewer playmates, but few dull moments, as he more often saw his cousins Now that was a change and had families. During that time Loraine Beatty, her husband Fred Beatty, and young Bobby Beatty left their home and moved across town into the large house on South Boulevard so that Hattie Beatty would not be alone. </p><p>South Boulevard was an extremely busy street, and was a major highway carrying traffic into South Carolina, or traffic moving from the south into North Carolina. Just across the street from Grandmother Beatty’s house was a very large garage where the city busses were parked every night, and where the same busses which traveled throughout Charlotte filled with passengers going to work, or home from work, or to town to shop or to physicians or dentists, or on Sunday, riding to church—and in almost every ride in whatever direction—later in the day those same people would have to go home again, riding the bus to get there. </p><p>Next to that garage was Lance Packing Company, the maker of thousands of packages of cheese crackers, and plain peanut butter crackers and potato chips, salted peanuts and other snacks. The street was always busy. because across the street from Grandmother Beatty’s house was a large bakery where Lance Crackers were made, along with other snacks. Grandmother Beatty had, for some long years, served a sort of boarding house lunch to employees of Lance Packing Company. One or two of the drivers lived with her, and a bunch of them ate their lunch at her table. Of course they paid her, as they would have had to pay for lunch eaten at a restaurant. </p><p>Now just about everything was changed in Grandmother Beatty’s house. One of the big thing was that </p><p>and Your Paw-paw Beatty was at this time about eight or nine years old. His family was living in a lovely house on Greenway Avenue, a street in Charlotte not far from Presbyterian Hospital. OnHis Beatty Grandparents were still living in the house his Father, Fred Oliver Beatty, had grown up in, located on South Boulevard which was a wide and quite busy street. Fred Oliver Beatty lived in his house on Grandfather Beattyparents had fairly recently moved into Please recall that your Paw-paw was about ten or eleven years old. Upon a summer evening Paw-paw’s Grandfather Grandfather, a City of Charlotte policeman, failed to return home when expected. Later that evening his son-in-law, Marvin (who was married to Paw-paws Aunt Virginia),went to Grandfather Beatty’s office, and discovered that he had died, sitting behind his office desk located in the Mecklenburg County Courthouse. </p><p>That unexpected sadness changed things for Paw-paw. His parents moved into the large house on South Boulevard—a very busy street—and just across that street was the car barn for the trolley cars which traveled on tracks all over Charlotte. Trolley’s allowed people to pay a minimum amount of money to ride across town to their jobs, or to keep appointments, or to go to a movie. It surely did beat walking for miles since not everyone had either a horse or a car. The move meant Paw-paw had to change schools, teachers, and playmates. The room he now called his was tiny, with little space for any sort of toys. He had to change schools, and at the new school he didn’t know anyone, and had a new teacher. At home the front yard was very small, and there was a fence in the back yard. No children lived on either side of his house, and the back yard opened on an alley (which was like an unpaved private street). All day, and all night there was noisy traffic along the street in front of his house, and it didn’t stop until late at night. This street, though it had houses on it, also had businesses, and right across the street was a huge garage, and people had dubbed it “the car barn” because every morning the streetcars left their garage and carried passengers from place to place all day, and then at night came back to their barn to be cleaned, and if needed, repaired, for the next day’s business. </p><p>A little below the huge garage that was called the “car barn” was a manufacturing plant for snacks like cheese crackers and potato chips and several other popular treats which sold for five cents in grocery stores and many other places that sold drinks and snacks wrapped in cellophane. Lance Packing Company made all sorts of treats, like peanuts, and cookies and crackers packaged in small amounts at low prices, and sold in a myriad of stores all over the city. </p><p>Paw-paw lived in the house owned by his Grandmother Beatty on that busy street that connected Pineville and points South to and actually through Charlotte to many parts of this continent. So we can leave information about the Yandle family from the age of ten until he was drafted into the military. When he returned, he again lived in that house, until the City of Charlotte decided to take all the land in that area for its own use—and cities and states and the Federal Government can actually do that—simply decide what the house and land are worth, pay the owners what they decide is fair, and make them move away whether or not they want to move. And that is the beginning of another part of the story. </p><hr/><p>The central streets in the heart of Charlotte were carefully laid out into a precise grid early in its history. One area was set aside to serve as a Court House, which would be where the town was governed. Many of the large cities of England and other countries in Europe had an important government center often called a Square. Charlotte also had a Square, which, when the city was founded, was set up in the very center of the town. In that spot a small wooden Courthouse was erected. From that point crude unpaved streets were laid out, running either east to west, or north to south from the Courthouse in the very center of the town. </p><p>The people who settled in the new town were generally from England, or some other European country. They were true pioneers. They made a town called Charlotte, and a state called North Carolina. They laid out farms, and planted them, and harvested There had been nothing there except trees when the people first arrived, mostly from Europe, other parts of the world, or from settlements further north on the Atlantic coast. The moving of people from England and Europe to this new country was not truly swift, nor was it ever easy to travel. However, settlements in this new world where only savages lived pushed Indians away from the Atlantic Coast, . I have heard stories of the way life was lived when my parents were growing up. I have heard a few stories of how my grandparents grew up. I was told stories about my great-grandparents. My Great Grandfather Yandle owned a grocery store. During the Civil War there were a fairly large number of women whose husbands had gone to war, leaving them without funds. If there were no family ties to come to their aid, my Great Grandfather Yandle would see starving women with young children, and help them by giving them food. Of course his store lost revenue. He kept on doing it as long as possible, until he could no longer pay his bills. His brother, Edward Yandle, helped him with the legal aspects of being unable to pay his suppliers. </p><p>Although I never saw Great Grandfather, or his wife, I heard stories about them both. My mother helped take care of his tiny wife after Great Grandfather died. She told me that the when someone passed her as she rocked in her small chair, she would pinch them—hard. It was always uncomfortable to be pinched by boney fingers that didn’t want to release their prey.<br/> If she wasn’t pinching someone, or having a meal, she would chant a little rhyme:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>            Samuel Yandle is my name,

My Dad remembered that he was quite young, and had snitched a cigar from the box that had been a present to his grandfather on the occasion. He and his cousins took their cigar out behind the barn, lit it and made them selves sick by taking turns smoking the cigar. There was a crowd there, and the adults—family, visitors, and quite elderly couple who had been married fifty years. The boys smoked, and to their dismay, had no appetite for the wonderful meal set out by the time they were called to the table. </p><p>My childish view of my bachelor Great Uncle Ed Yandle was that he was absolutely and totally strange. He was well educated, and had a fabulous vocabulary—and though I didn’t realize it, he spoke like an Englishman because his parents had been English before they became Americans. My father held Uncle Edward in high respect. However, he was always using big words I didn’t understand. I remember one of his visits when I was about five years old. We were just sitting down to lunch when he came into the house. Mother invited him to eat with us. He said, “I don’t have room.” It was a fact that our small table, at that moment, didn’t have space for another chair. My mother immediately stood up, crowded my five year old self against my sister’s chair at one end of the table, and quickly brought an extra chair to the table. Within seconds she had placed a clean plate, silverware, and a glass of water onto the table, and asked Uncle Ed to sit at the table. He came to the table, sat, and chuckled. “I didn’t mean there was no place to sit” he admitted, “I meant I didn’t have room in my alimentary canal.” </p><p>Uncle Edward lived in a house on East Fifth Street which he shared with his sister, Lizzie. The house, itself, intrigued me because instead of having one way to have light after the sun went down, that house had two ways of producing light. One was, of course, electricity. And it didn’t show me any surprises. The other method used narrow gold colored pipes, and had tiny, very fragile white globes above tiny pipes on each side of the mantels. There was one in every room, and if you turned a little lever you could hear a hiss, and then if you struck a match, a gas flame began to burn. Unlike a kerosene lamp, you couldn’t move these, and you could not touch the fragile white netting above the small pipe, where the flame danced when the valves were open so the gas could hiss out into the white netting. If you even touched that white netting, even if it was by accident, it would crumble away, and the light wouldn’t work anymore. I didn’t realize why my Great Aunt Lizzie, and her brother, Great Uncle Edward, would want two separate ways to have light in their home. In my old age I realized that gas was probably used when they lived in England in their early youth, and they were accustomed to the use of gas lights. When they came here from England they quite naturally wanted the same kind of lighting in their home. However, when electricity was available, it was superior to the gas lights. They took advantage of the better lighting furnished by electricity, but did not discard the gas light source, and when there were power outages, they still would have light. </p><p>Aunt Lizzie was a spinster, and shared a house with her brother, Uncle Edward; however, some years previously there had been a young niece living there also. Aunt Lizzie had raised her sister’s daughter when her sister was unable to look after her. I never saw that girl, but I was told she was particularly beautiful, as well as intelligent. She had learned from a teacher how to play an organ, and her organ still sat in Aunt Lizzie’s front room when I was a child. Sadly, the young girl Aunt Lizzie loved and cared for so carefully contracted an illness, and died at the age of about eighteen. Aunt Lizzie, unmarried and childless, had raised the girl. It was a delight to Aunt Lizzy that the girl was beautiful, obedient, every inch a lady, and a well trained organist. She was also described a lovely and talented girl. Aunt Lizzie never truly recovered from her grief. She could not, or would not, say the dead girl’s name, or discuss anything about the child she, herself, raised. In her old age Aunt Lizzie stayed for several months at our house, and had to share a room with me, though we had separate beds. Aunt Lizzie did not complain, nor did I, We had different daily and nightly schedules. You might guess that I didn’t enjoy that period because she was peculiar in her habits. She would never touch a door knob with her bare hands, but always put a corner of her apron between her hand and the doorknob. There were foods she would not eat. She was particular about her laundry and her clothing—her underwear could not be hung outside on the line to dry for fear someone outside the family would see them. Her fragile health prevented her from helping with the household chores, but it didn’t stop her from lecturing me on how to do it. </p><p>and children without support. My Great GrandfatherYandle would ran a store, in Pineville I think. When the wives and children of Confederate soldiers had no food, he gave them goods out of his store anyway. The town grew. Of course it took time, but children were born, and new people eventually arrived, adding to the population. Stores were built, goods were offered for sale. Churches were started. More people came to the new continent. Places and areas were given names, and Carolina was born. Settlers of many persuasions and divers beliefs came, some speaking divers of languages. The first group of people who came into what is now North Carolina simply disappeared, and no one has ever discovered what happened to them. People who kept coming to the shores of what is now Virginia, and also what is now North Carolina had huge problems, and many did not survive. The hearty ones reveled in the work of staying alive in a strange part of the world. Once here in America the settlers sometimes had really difficult times. First, they brought very little with them. Second, there were tribes of Indians already living here, and some of them were hostile. Being unfamiliar with the terrain a well as the weather was difficult. The new people were not sure of what they could eat, or what it would be better to avoid. Most of them had never built houses, or chosen locations for a house, nor did they have an infinite amount of supplies for their survival. Their ammunition was scarce, they had no horses, they did not have copious amounts of food, clothing,, or other necessities. They couldn’t go back to England, But they did know how to work—and they did.</p><p>Europe, especially England, was crowded. People were fairly eager to try the new world. There were more people than there were houses, and all wooden Courthouse in the center of a busy square that was proudly named Independence Square. In the earliest days in the center of that Square there was a small Court House. Streets leading to and from the Square were laid out in precise North-South or East-West directions, <strong><em>*</em></strong>****making a neat grid across the growing town. The North-South road that went through the Square was called Tryon Street. The East-West road was called Trade Street. At precise intervals perpendicular streets were laid out in blocks. There was a “first” street, and a “second” street, and the roads that pointed north or south were given names, too. Some were named for Governers or army officers, or for the usage of that street, like the one that was named Trade Street because it had so many stores along it. at first streets going east to west, (or vice versa) given numbers, and those when they ran North or South, they had names, though of course there were exceptions to that pattern. east or west, and names when they ran North or South. There were four numbered streets on one side of the Court House, but the count was interrupted when the centraand as years passed, there were at least thirty six streets that were numbered. in precise squares, with named streets running north or south, and numbered streets running east or west, but the numbering went from First Street north to Second Street. By the time that the . Of course there were not many streets laid out at the beginning. As the city grew the numbered streets were expanded, and I think they rose as high as Thirty-Sixth Street before other names were used, however, the town expanded eastward, as well as westward, and the eastward streets began with “First” and couldn’t go any lower, so the new streets eastward also had names rather than numbers. Before my parents married they both lived in the area of Pineville, a small town that was, in my youth, about ten miles from the Charlotte City Limits. As the seventy-five years of my life unfolded, the distance between Pineville and Charlotte diminished, until today it is less easy to tell the difference. When I was a child most of the land near Pineville that stretched in any direction was farm land. Pineville was a little more than ten miles from Charlotte. My Yandle—grandparents lived less than a mile from Pineville if they walked to the town along the railroad track. , as well as my Parks grandparents lived near Pineville, but not within the town. They were farmers, growing their own food crops for both animals and themselves, and earned money by selling some of their produce. </p><p>My Daddy parents family lived on West Eleventh Street, Charlotte was quite small when it began, and the authorities who named the streets started, of course must have picked a place to begin the numbered streets, and counted upward. Strang, with First Street which was extended to either the East or to the West. The streets extending North or South from the central Square had names. people who laid out the streets began decided to number the East to West streets, and name the North to South streets, but there had to be a starting place. the numbered streets began with First Street, which ran East and West. A measured block away Second Street was laid out, and a system was in place. Whoever and the dividing point was the position of the Square, which was literally smack-dab in the middle of the town. Beyond the Square, the names of the street counted upward—except that as the city grew, there was a lot more space for counting on the western side of the square, and though I never searched for the highest number I know it went as far as Thirty-Sixth Street. . nleaving space for houses or buildings and from it there were two roads—Tryon Street, and Trade Street—both of which were extended in straight lines away from the Square. Trade Street ran East and West, and Tryon Street ran North and South. Stores and places of trade eventually lined the streets close to the Court House. Eventually other streets were laid out. crossed. That intersection was large because a small building serving as the Court House Charlotte sat in the middle of it. At some point that Square was given a name: Independence Square. It was declared the center of the town. Of course, stores and houses were built along the streets. Eventually the streets were all named, and all paved. Streets leading away from the Square specifically led either North-South, or East-West. The Square was the center of the town. Streets already in use to the east of the square fffff had a Square that was named Independence Square, and in its center , too, had a Square, whi—where The place where the courthouse stood streets leading to the Courthouse, in the very center of the town, were wide, and spread away from the center in precise directions: North-South, and East-West. The divider was the Courthouse, which sat in the very middle of a square, dividing North from South, and East from West. The East-West streets were numbered, and the North-South streets were named in those early days. From First Street to Fourth Street the numbered streets stretched east of the Square. Beyond the Square the numbered streets expanded as the city grew. Though I don’t know precisely how many streets were actually numbered, I do know that Thirty-sixth street existed, but don’t remember if the numbers grew any larger. Some of the North-South streets that were named in the blocks close to Eleventh Street were given names such as Pine, and Popular, and then Church, <strong><em>*</em></strong> , the to the west the numbered streets began with were west—and therefore the fifth when the town expanded The streets that ran square from which the north-south directions were divided. that were straight, and exact, carefully running either east-west, or aligned exactly north-south, depending on the direction you needed to go. The center of the city was called “the square” , which was a It was divided into square sections of mostly the same exact size that were called “blocks” on which housing appeared, with small yards before the house, and another small yard behind it, as well. The east-west streets were numbered. The north-south streets were named. </p><p>Our house was on the other side of town. We were only eleven blocks from the center of uptown Charlotte, on West Eleventh Street. Eleventh Street was comparatively wider than most of the other numbered streets between Eleventh and the to many other numbered streets which also ran west to east (or vice versa), and it the other numbered strIt was probably about 1935 or 1936 that the City of Charlotte made a big change in the public transportation. In the middle of the street that went by our house on West Eleventh Street there was a track—smaller than, but resembling, a train track. Along that track trolleys rolled, one at a time. The trolley , and stop at intersections for people to get on, or get off. It was a funny sort of car, because both ends of it were the front. it a single trolley would offered to the public. Until then there were trolly cars, much like the ones you see pictured in San Francisco, which pull power from lines overhead to run the cars, and carry people from where they are, to where they want to go. <strong><em>*</em></strong>which traveled on rails sort of like trains, except that there were cables high above the tracks, and on top of the trolly cars was a small device that touched the electrical lines and ran on electricity. </p><p>ne building just across the street was called “the car barn”It was a fairly large house, and Paw-paw’s Grandmother </p><p>Shortly after the family moved in with his grandparents, his Grandfather Beatty, a City of Charlotte policeman, died suddenly of a heart attack while at his desk in the City Hall. After that sad occurrence Paw-paw’s parents did not leave his grandmother alone in her house, but lived there for a long time. The Beatty family was still living on South Boulevard in 1941. </p><p>In Europe and in Japan there was trouble—not just some small misunderstanding between nations, but two highly dangerous world-wide troubles. German Leaders decided to take over all of Europe, claiming they were superior people, who deserved to take over all the other countries on that continent. On a group of relatively small islands in the Pacific, another country decided that every part of the Pacific Ocean and the islands and continents within or surrounded by it should allow the Japanese to rule over them. Other nations disagreed, and War was declared in both Europe and the Pacific Islands. Germany, and it’s ally Italy, along with Japan, had armies, navies, and air forces to attack the cities and homes, and the myriad armed forces headquarters scattered around the world where there were military basses and materials. There were also ships there which could be called war ships—simply because they had the capability of protecting themselves and any ships they were escorting across the sea from attack by pirates or by any other source. A fleet of United States Navy ships were in the harbor of one of the Hawaiian Islands, along Army Air Force planes. They were there to defend the Islands. The Japanese didn’t want America to have the capability of <strong><em>*</em></strong>**They planned to steal whole countries by invading them quickly and without mercy—killing, destroying, and taking over other countries and its citizens. They killed not only soldiers, airmen, sailors, marines, and civilians, but they also decided that if they simply destroyed the governments and the homes of ordinary people in the countries they wanted to steal. isimply steal and destroy claim every inch of the land they prepared for . and the Japanese . Germany decided to take over Europe and the world, and the Japanese, feeling very cramped in their small country, decided to destroy every nation they could—China, and the United States, in particular, so that they could rule their part of the World. On December 7, 1941, they attacked the United States Navy as well as the Air Force without warning, and sank ships, and bombed military posts in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii take over every nation they could were living there in 1941 when the war began. Because it became a law that as soon as able bodied young men became eighteen years old they were eligible for the draft, and if they were able bodied, and not mentally incompetent they were trained as a soldier. Young men who wanted fervently to choose which service they would serve could join before they were drafted, and actually report for duty after graduation from high school. Paw-paw was one of the men who made that choice. He enlisted in the Army Air Force before he graduated from high school, and was therefore not called to duty until after he graduated that spring. Shortly after that date he received instructions about where and when he was to report, and he was sent to a hotel on the Atlantic Beach for his first training. </p><p>men who enlisted before they were called could choose their service. because that way he couto prevent his being drafted into which ever service wanted him—without his consent. If he enlisted, he could pick his choice of service. Therefore, he enlisted in the Army The year Paw-paw graduated from High School he was already eighteen years old, and he would have been drafted as soon as he graduated. . He wanted to choose which service he would serve in, and settled on the Army Air Force was finishing his last year in high school. After December 7, 1941 Paw-paw had one more year of school, and th </p><p>My sister was six full years plus a few months older than me. When Harding High School opened its doors for the first time Ella Cornelia was a seventh grader. Hers was the first class to complete six full years at Harding. The earlier graduation classes had transferred to Harding after attending other schools. The year after Ella Cornelia graduated, I entered seventh grade at Harding. This was my first opportunity to choose the subjects or classes I took. I was much impressed at the idea of having such wonderful choices, and I was a little dismayed when I discovered that the seventh graders didn’t have many choices since the classes for seventh grade students were almost all mandatory, with few possible alternate classes. All seventh graders had the same subjects, except that boys were not required to take home economics. </p><p>It was a great relief when I discovered that I could re-arrange my schedule so that I could play violin in the school orchestra, however, to do so I had to give up my “free” period that the school named “study hall”. I truly loved the practice with the school orchestra, and I was glad when the orchestra played before all the students during an “assembly” or upon the rare occasion when we played at a PTA meeting, or special event. Once each year the Junior Choir would present an operetta for which the orchestra provided accompaniment, so I played my violin in all six of the operettas while I was at Harding. These were high points for me. Unfortunately Queens College did not have an orchestra, so I didn’t use my violin there, nor did I practice after I left college. So I “lost” my ability to play.<br/> When I enrolled at Queens I discovered that some of the high school courses my parents demanded that I study were not a fortunate choice after all. Since my mother insisted I take Home Economics for three years I didn’t have an opportunity to take chemistry, earth sciences, or geometry. There wasn’t room in my schedule. There was only one year of the six high school years that I didn’t have classes all day without the relief of a study hall. My classes were so packed there was no room for me to take high school geometry either. And there was a conflict the year I would have had science (the class where students cut up a dead frog). Therefore, when I went to college I was compelled to take a couple of subjects I could have avoided had I been able to take them in High School. However, I was glad that when I married I could cook, with three years of home economics behind me. And when my children were born, I could sew clothes for them. However, studying all the things my parents had chosen for me, and sticking to my choice to stay in the orchestra, I discovered I lacked studies in science that were mandatory for graduation from Queens College. I had to take a couple of remedial classes, and spent one summer taking the only math subject being offered—Trigonometry. That course was a trial for me, not because I am dumb, but because I had not had geometry—normally a prerequisite for Trigonometry. However, I braved it out, achieving my goal—I had the hours, and I passed the subject of Trigonometry. When the fall semester began I was ready for it, and joyfully continued with my last year in college. </p><p>My sister, Ella Cornelia, graduated from Harding in June of 1941. That same June I finished sixth grade, and would be attending Seventh Grade at Harding High School in that Fall. My sister was elated to be out of school, and was eager to jump into the experience of working for a living. Family friends operated a small office for a major insurance company, and they offered Ella Cornelia, a job. She took the proffered job, and worked happily there for a while. However, she truly believed she wanted to go to college, and in the fall of 1941 she enrolled at a college in the mountains of North Carolina. She had earned a little over the summer, and Mother and Daddy were helping her with tuition, so she trotted off to the mountains to college. I’m not sure what Ella Cornelia thought college would be like, but whatever she expected she didn’t find it. Her roommate was from a well-to-do family of German extraction, and the ordinary courses that freshmen take when they enroll in any college did not fascinate either of them. In that small mountain town there were few, if any, exciting places to visit. The campus was small, and though the views were quite lovely in hill country they don’t change very much from day to day. The relatively small community was a small mountain town—not offering very much in the way of entertainment such as Charlotte could provide. The studies were just that—and not riveting. Ella Cornelia had never loved the unexciting every day lessons of school. She didn’t have even one exciting friend in her new location, and the only person she really knew was her room mate who didn’t like the school either. Ella Cornelia stuck it out until Christmas Vacation. Then she decide she didn’t like college well enough to stick it out. So she and her room mate packed their clothes and accoutrements and took a bus to Charlotte. Her former roommate came with her, and stayed at our house a day or two, then left for her own home. </p><p>On the About a week later The year was December of 1941. It was almost Christmas. So my sister and her room mate decided to dump the whole idea. When, and came home for Christmas with no plans to return to college. Mother and Daddy regretted her decision, but didn’t try to change her mind. My sister quickly found a new job as secretary to a two man insurance agency with some old friends of my parents, and she was a working woman again. </p><p>I had been eager to become a “high school” student. In many communities seventh grade was not high school. It could be “Middle School,” or a Junior High School, but not a Senior High School. Harding High school was sort of unique in our city because it incorporated six grades—Grades seven to twelve, and could not be called less than High School because then the senior high students would have been more than a little upset, so it was called Harding High School from the beginning, even though Junior High students also attended there. </p><p>My seventh grade studies began in September, and I was pleased with my teachers, extremely happy with my elective class which was orchestra. I found friends I had known in sixth grade with whom I could walk to school. I had mostly new clothes to start the school year because I was growing tall, and I was—well, I thought I was at least o.k. looking, even if I was a little chubby. I had been both sorry and glad that I needed all new clothes because I had grown taller as well as maturing so that most of my blouses sort of strained across my chest. I had also grown taller during the summer causing few of the clothes I had worn in sixth grade were wearable for my seventh grade year. Since my sister had planned to go to college and needed new clothes that fall, my mother had delayed sewing for me—after all, I wasn’t really going anywhere. I wasn’t pleased with the situation, but I accepted it, and didn’t complain. Then there was a sudden chill in the air, and there was frost on the ground one morning. I put on my last winter’s coat, and I couldn’t button it. It had become too short. My arms were too long for the sleeves. I had outgrown it. The real problem was that I really didn’t have a coat I could wear and it really was cold that morning. So I wore my too tight coat. </p><p>I didn’t enjoy making a problem for my mother. There I was, with almost no winter clothes to wear, and no coat. Since my mother was a seamstress she always made my clothes. I suddenly needed “everything” and in her sweet pleasure for my sister’s decision to go to college which began much earlier than my school year, she had not yet made me new clothes. I had outgrown my winter coat. My winter clothes were all too small for me. And now the weather, which had been very mild up until that moment—had turned cold. </p><p>I had nothing to wear to school, so mother made me put on a sweater that would close over my chest, and helped me squeeze into my coat </p><p>In one short period of ten minutes or so, I ruined my mother’s day, and became a problem where my clothing was concerned. </p><p>New clothes for me were indicated, and Mother quickly lengthened skirts and let out seams until I had winter clothes to wear. It wasn’t an error that I had made, so I wasn’t upset, but I did feel that somehow I had let my mother down by making her work late into the night for several days so that I could have clothes to wear to school. </p><p>I was happy to begin my first year of high school. I made a friend named Sue the very first day. I liked my classes. I loved orchestra. I walked a mile to and from school carrying an armload of books and my violin. I loved walking home with Sue, and often walked several blocks beyond the intersection where I would part from Sue and walk one more block to home. </p><p>I knew that I had chores to do when I arrived at home after school at about 3:25 every day. When the weather was cool it was my chore to bring in coal and light a fire in the stove. I also was to wash any soiled plates and glasses left from breakfast. If mother had told me what to fix for supper I would begin to prepare the meal. I almost always made the biscuits, and cooked the vegetables. Actually we didn’t eat a lot of meat. </p><p>When I arrived home in cold weather my first chore was to make a fire in the laundry heater to warm the kitchen, and bring in enough coal to keep it going as long as it would be needed. Then I could do my homework. If I wasn’t finished with my school work by four-thirty I had to put my books away and start making supper. I rarely had real “from scratch”cooking to do. I could make slaw, and biscuits, and warm home canned food from the pantry, and I could wash green vegetables and put them in a pot for cooking. if I had homework, my parents expected me to finish it before bed time. If there were soiled dishes I was to wash them. If mother had given me instructions for supper I was to complete them. However if I had no homework, I had the afternoon for reading, and I did love to read. I was one of the best customers the library had, and I was rarely without a book if I was alone in the house.</p><p>Mother usually arrived between five-thirty and six o’clock, but I didn’t expect Daddy until just before dark. When he arrived he had chores to do before he could eat—he had to put away his painting supplies and wash out his brushes, and sometimes he laid out the paints and drop cloths and brushes for the next day. Only then would he be free to come into the house for his supper. </p><p>When I could sit down in the kitchen, I loved listening to the radio, and sometimes I turned it on when I was washing dishes. Since Mother was working I had </p><p>esoe if I was working in the house, or if I had a book to read I was happy. I hadn’t yet read I loved to readWe had radio, and I loved to read. I also had lessons to There were some radio programs that I enjoyed, and I often turned on our radio when I was alone in the kitchen. There were only three stations in Charlotte, and if there was nothing on the radio I wanted to listen to, I could always read a book—because I loved to read. I was rarely uneasy if I was alone. I usually kept the doors locked because we lived in a neighborhood near when I was alonenever lonely nor did I feel frightened when I was alone. I could lock my front door, and the back door was locked before I left home that morning.left me a note about supper, I had to fix part of the meal , I had toIt I had two or three breakfast dishes to wash, and if it was cold outside I had to bring in coal and make a fire in the kitchen stove. Mother would make supper when she came home, unless she had left me instructions to cook something. I had the house to myself for about two hours. I could and usually did listen to the radio My mother was still working at the sewing shop, my Daddy had plenty of work as a paint contractor, and I liked my new friend named with whom I walked to school. In the afternoons I usually walked halfway to Sue’s house with her, then retraced about four blocks to my own home, because Sue didn’t like to walk alone. who lived a little more than half a mile up the street from my house. I had a bed room to myself, and my little world was rosy. My sister was still away in college when my school year began. and that made me a sort of “only” child since I was the only one at home, which I relished. </p><p>month before my matriculation at Harding, our lives were changed by circumstances neither we, nor our families, had control over. Japanese air planes dropped bomb on and American Naval Station in Hawaii and the United States declared war on Japan, and on Germany and Italy as well. </p><p>Charlotte’s schools always had Christmas vacations—about ten days or so—before school resumed. Early in December it was dark before six o’clock, and that Sunday evening</p><p>ess than six months before I began my seventh grade studies, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the United States entered the war almost immediately. Though there had been peace in our country for some years, the armed services still existed in our country, but I had never actually seen a soldier in all of my life until after December 7, 1941. My Dad had been in the Merchant Marines near the time of the First World War. When his ship docked in foreign places he usually bought small souvenirs to take home, and there were some photographs of him in his sailor’s uniform with some of his buddies. He bought a small shellacked box in China, and for all of his life it sat in the middle of the Dresser in his room, holding a few mementos of his voyages, and some small trinkets he bought while abroad. There were pictures of himself in uniform in China, and other places where he made landfall. He had not been in battles, but he had seen a lot of the world when he returned home. I was very grateful that he did not have to go into the armed services again. He was over forty years old at that time, and not eligible for service. </p><p>I remember how glad I was that my Daddy didn’t have to go to war. There was a family living across the street from our house. The father worked, the mother stayed home, and their two grown children lived with them. Their son joined the Air Force soon after Pearl Harbor was bombed, and after his training he was assigned to duty in Europe. When he first joined the Air Force his mother bought a small flag with a blue star in its center to hang in her living room window. It was something families did when someone in their family went to war, so that everyone who saw it knew someone from that home was in service. One day his mother replaced the blue star with a gold one. Her son’s plane had gone down over Europe, and he was buried there. </p><p>Suddenly, the Depression that had caused hardships for almost every person in our country was over. Instead of out of work persons begging for jobs, jobs were begging for people to do them. Factories that made war materials discovered that most young men were in the military, and there were not enough workers to do the job of building ships and airplanes and munitions—so women were hired to build ships and planes, and to make munitions. There was a popular song about Rosie the Riveter that was played with pride on radio stations. Women became ambulance drivers and factory workers, and they filled many jobs that only men had previously held. </p><p>We, (my parents, my sister, and I) resided in Charlotte on West Eleventh Street, a location which does not now exist as it has been incorporated into a ramp leading to an interstate highway. My Dad’s parents, along with his only brother and two unmarried sisters, lived on the family farm near Pineville. His sister Pauline, the youngest daughter, was married. She and her husband rented a house only about three minute walk from the family farm. My Dad’s mother was blind and an invalid, but his father still helped Uncle Eddie with the farm chores. Two of my Dad’s sisters were “old maids” when the war began, and they, too, were still living at home. The Yandle home place was a little bit more than a mile from the town of Pineville. When my Uncle Eddie wanted or needed to walk to Pineville where there were stores, he usually followed the railroad tracks because it was the shorter distance by about half a mile, and in addition was safer than dodging fast moving automobiles on the highway. W</p><p>My Mother’s parents lived on several acres of farm land not far from the South Carolina border, and only a little more than a mile from my Dad’s parents. I have only a vague and shadowed memory of their home place, mostly because I was only about five years old when they decided to abandon their own home and move in with my Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance. Grandmother Parks had suffered a heart attack, and Grand-daddy Parks was getting too old to till his fields or care for his stock. For all of his life Grand-daddy and Grandmother Parks had attended Flint Hill Baptist church not far from their home and easily reached by horse and buggy. </p><p>They made the decision to move into werehat house to live with my Aunt Ola when I was about five years old. I do have a faint memory of that house because on the last Sunday my mother’s parents would be in their own home built on their own farm, I had a wonderful treat. </p><p>They had moved from their When I was about five years old they left their own home on their farm and moved in with their oldest daughter, my Aunt Ola, and her husband Vance Davis, who had no children. to the home of their oldest daughter, my Aunt Ola. Uncle Vance, her husbandhouseThey, too, were living with one of their children—my Aunt Ola, and her husband, Vance Davis. other had one sister, Ola Davis, who lived near Pineville, and two brothers. One living with his family in Fort Mill, South Carolina, and the other living with his wife a little further away, also South Carolina. We saw Aunt Ola and her husband, Uncle Vance quite often. Uncle Vance was a farmer, the son of a farmer. He was also a man of all work. There was a forge in his back yard, a workshop in his “basement” A convenient distance from his back door there was an “out-house toilet” along a shady path an and a little beyond that there was a large building that served at least two or three major needs: One, was that it was a chicken house, and like most other chicken houses it was usually ankle deep in chicken droppings. However, in neat boxes along both sides of the building there were boxes for the large number of hens to lay eggs in. Like most farmers who kept lots of chickens, their droppings were used for fertilizer. Aunt Ola sold the eggs or used them, but she also “saved” some of them in large jars, and I never discovered how they tasted, or why she did it, or even how she did it. I did see large glass containers that would hold at least three gallons, filled with some sort of clear gel, with eggs suspended within it, not touching each other. Aunt Ola was, to me, a wonder woman. She did not have running water in her house until I was a teenager. She did not have electricity in her house until World War II ended. She used a pedal sewing machine, and I often saw her make quilts. </p><p>Aunt Ola never threw away bits of cloth sturdy enough to become part of a quilt. She always kept a “rag” bag in which to store scraps of cloth culled from the “good” pieces of worn out or torn clothing or bits and pieces left over from making new clothing. Her quilts most often had a carefully cut pattern of pieces of cloth sewn together to make a colorful and pleasant coverlet. The coverlet could serve as a quilt, and also as a pleasant “spread” through out the day. The filling of the quilts—what was sandwiched between the fabric of the top and bottom of the quilt—was combed cotton. Cotton bolls straight from the field were relieved of their seeds, and combed between two the fabric on the bottom of the was carefully placed and “quilted” with hundreds of small stitches so that the cotton between the top and bottom of a quilt would stay in place, and provide warmth for a number of years. </p><p>Quilts had two surfaces, and between them Aunt Ola would lay evenly carded cotton battens, which she carded herself from cotton straight from her own fields. This was a tedious sort of operation. Aunt Ola would have to remove the seeds from the cotton, then put wads of cotton balls on one batten and use the battens (like a really stiff hair brush, only it was made with thin nails the field had cotton seeds buried in the balls of white cotton. These were picked out, and the soft cotton balls placed between two paddles with handles. The paddles were like a slender piece of wood with thin nails sticking out from one side in careful rows. It took two paddles to find the seeds. tapped Since quilts had two surfaces between which were cotton battens (Aunt Ola’s battens were home made on wooden paddles with sturdy teeth that would comb the cotton seeds from the cotton balls that had been harvested from her own fields) that were from “combs” with which she for warmth, Aunt Ola would buy new material to make borders between the blocks she had so carefully designed </p><p>, and then making other square the same size, with the same colors if possible, or with squares that would compliment each other.

Then she would fit the blocks together, usually separating them by placing a strips of “bought” cloth that would frame the blocks both vertically and horizontally, making a “quilt top”.

One of his sisters was married, and lived within five minutes walking distance of her parent’s house, and her two sisa small distance within walking distance of the Two of his three sisters still lived at home, and took care of their parents along with his only brother. The other sister was married, and lived with her husband in a house about a block away from her parent’s house. Pauline, the married one, worked in Charlotte. In that day and time she was the unusual one—she drove her own automobile to her job in Charlotte, and back again in the evening. The rest of my father’s siblings still lived at home with their elderly parents. My grandmother was bedridden, and blind. <strong><em>*</em></strong>*and drove her own car to work each day. I had never seen my Aunt Helen anywhere except at home, where she took care of her invalid mother (my grandmother) and cooked for her parents, and her brother and sister. Uncle Eddie took care of the fields and their livestock my Grandparents , daddy, my Uncle Eddie, who took care of their livestock, and worked their fields. My Aunt Martha had once studied as a nurse, but became ill, and was unable to complete her training. She took care of my grandmother who was blind. But Aunt Martha, whom I had never seen in any garment except a dress, put on coveralls, and went to work a secret place that was called simply, the shell plant. I never saw it, and I never knew exactly where it was. The people who worked there never talked about what they did, nor did they mention where it was located. They worked there until the plant closed after the war ended. All during that time my Aunt Ola picked up my Aunt Martha every day, and those two ladies worked at the shell plant until the war was over. in my grandparents house. two of them away from their home. The youngest one, Aunt Pauline, had gone to college and worked in Charlotte, though she lived in Pineville. They had no transportation of their own. My mother’s sister Ola could drive a car, and she and her farmer husband owned a 1929 Ford. A building that I never saw was built in a place I never heard named, but it could be reached by an automobile. My Aunt Ola was whom I had never seen at </p><p>Two of my aunts made weapons in a secret plant located somewhere between Pineville and Charlotte, North Carolina. I was a curious child, but they never told me exactly what they did when they were at work. These were women who had never in their lives worn men’s clothing—but now they wore overalls because it was required. One of these aunts was an old maid, and I had seen her away from her house only once or twice in my life. She so rarely went anywhere it was a shock to me to see her away from home. My other aunt had a 1929 Ford car, but she, too, had never worked outside her house. I had never known her to go anywhere except to church. I don’t remember that she had ever even been to Charlotte to visit her only sister—my mother. But during the war my Aunt Ola Davis drove to the house of my Grandmother Yandle to pick up my Aunt Martha, and the two of them went to work at a secret place that was built after the war began to make something secret to be used to fight the war. Neither Aunt would tell me what the </p><p>had never worked at a job outside her home, and didn’t have a car. My other aunt lived about a mile from her house, and I had never in all my ten or eleven years of life seen the two of them together. They recognized each other, but I had never seen them together. When the war began there were so many needs that jobs were plentiful, and skilled people were excused form service in the military if they were already doing something important, such as making ammunition, or army uniforms, or building airplanes. Salaries in the armed forces were small—but the men were clothed, housed, trained, and they paid for none of that training. and until war began was still affecting wages, prices, investments, building, and therefore keeping the economy from growing was completely over. The government was spending money building Army Posts, Marine stations, Air Force bases, as well as purchasing weapons, building factories to make bombs and uniforms and boots and guns. Housing was needed for the service men, so contractors were rushed to complete new naval, marine, army, and air force locations, and mills along with factories were making shoes, caps, uniforms, blankets, and other items for use by the armed forces. </p><p>, as well as the houses people lived in and the jobs available to those who wanted to work, was over. The government was eager to build up an army, a navy, and marines. There was a need for air plane pilots, and places to train them. There were demands for motorized vehicles, from tanks to smaller vehicles to drive, not only within training camps, but on battlegrounds. The Jeep was born, and produced quickly. In December of 1941 when the Japanese attack occurred there were still pockets of our nation that had remained devastated by the Financial Depression. The Depression was over when factories were opened to make war materials. Men left their civilian jobs to join the services. Women, too, were able to join the women’s branch of both Army and Navy, and I think women could also join the Air Force. When men suddenly dropped their jobs to join the military there was a change in the United States. Instead of a depressed economy, the people who had jobs were begging women to come to work because so many men had enlisted—now there weren’t enough men to fill all the positions that were open and begging to be filled. Nurses and Doctors left their civilian practices to become physicians within the services. Nurses followed them into battle areas. People died. Wherever there were battles there were casualties. The German attacks in Europe devastated most of those countries. The Germans attacked the Russians, France, England, and other nations in Europe. The Japanese wanted to rule the countries surrounded by the Pacific Ocean. They were fighting China, and many of the islands in the Pacific. Germany had an ally in Italy and was fighting France and Poland, and many other small countries in that part of the world. Airplanes were used to drop bombs, destroying the cities, interrupting transportation, and the ability to and Italy, in Europe and Japan in the East were attacking their neighbors.

I graduated from the same school in 1949, and spent the next four years at Queens College, graduating with an AB degree in 1953. In the years of my schooling there was a World War—the second one for our country. </p><p>Strangely, Ella Cornelia and I took nearly the same subjects in High School. She found a job quickly, and worked for a while in an insurance office. This was not particularly fascinating. So she enrolled at Lees McRae College, up in the mountains of North Carolina. With the war going full blast college was less and less fulfilling. Ella Cornelia had worked in an office in town, and had worked in her teens in a five and dime store. She left school at the Christmas Holiday, and did not return. She found a job, and volunteered at Memorial Hospital as a Nurses Aid. A little later she worked as a secretary in a physician’s office, and some years later she worked at Memorial Hospital in the X-ray Department, typing up reports on the X-rays of patients. She was working there when World War II ended.</p><p>When I was old enough to notice how our city was put together because I had to walk to school, and after school walk almost a mile to the Quite early in the history of Charlotte the city streets were laid out, The city streets of Charlotte were laid out years in precise squares, and eventually the streets were paved, as well as side walks on both sides of the road. ago, Our neighborhood streets were laid out in even sized blocks. The corner houses faced only one street, though along one of their houses there was another street. Our house was the first one on that block of West Eleventh Street, but it was not on a corner. The first house on Pine Street was the corner house, with its back door opening on Eleventh Street, beside the front of our house. Our two story house was a duplex, with two front doors and two back doors, and one central wall between the two dwellings. Each side was a mirror image of the layout of the other. There was one roof for both houses. There were porches at the back as well as the front of the house. At the back, the porches were latticed and had screen wire on the inside to keep out flies and mosquitoes. It was divided evenly, with a solid wall between the two porches, presumably for privacy. Both front porches, and the rooms within each side of the duplex, were mirror images of each other, with a common center wall and no access from one house to the other. When the people who lived next door were friends, the stay-at-home wives could bang on the kitchen wall, and yell, “come over for coffee (or iced tea)” and the ladies could share a brief rest from their household chores, along with a friendly chat. My mother was delighted that when I was about five years old we acquired new neighbors who had a little girl close to my age. She was a bit bigger than me, but my same age. Children my age were scarce on our street, and at first it seemed wonderful to have a playmate my own age. However, my pleasure was short lived. That little girl rarely came outside without her older brother who was already in his teens. He, I discovered, had a mean streak, and thoroughly enjoyed tormenting me, since he was forbidden by his parents to torment his sister. He was not allowed to trip, or push, or hit his sister. He well knew his parents would not tolerate that—but I didn’t count, and he showed his sister how much fun it could be if the two of them finagled me into a trap where I could—and did—bet hurt. They both seemed to enjoy that. They caught me twice in their little jokes, and she dropped my only baby doll and broke it. We were compelled to walk to school together in first and </p><p>could, and did, urge her to help him trap me so that both of them could have a laugh at my expense. I clearly remember one of the last tricks he played on me: He was playing with a rope, tying his sister’s feet, or her hands, and then letting her go. I was the spectator. Then he made a circle of his rope, and invited his sister to jump in and out of the rope circle while he held one end of the rope. She held the rope several times while he, himself jumped in and out. He invited me to do it, and I said no. He and his sister pretended to be having a wonderful time jumping into and out of the rope that lay quietly on the ground. Then he coaxed me to take turns with his sister and since she was doing it with me, I thought I was probably safe. me to jump in and out of the circle. When we were both playing I didn’t mind doing it. But then the little Betty wanted to do it by herself, indicating that we could do it in turns. However when I jumped into the small circle the big brother jerked the loop and tied my feet together then jerked it so that I fell hard on the ground, scraping my elbow. I was—if you want to know—not amused in the least, because my elbow was skinned, the rope put a burn on my ankles, and my dress had red dirt on it where that big boy had pulled me on the dirt. I never did trust either one of them again. been . The brother and sister laughed like hyenas. . For a long time there had been no children my age for me to play with. There were no other children really close to my age in the neighborhood, at least not close to us, though my sister had found one close friend and several other acquaintances to grow up with. When my mother let me play the new neighbor’s child, I was not delighted. She was larger than me, a few months older than me, and bossy. Besides that, she had an older brother that was mean as a snake. She liked that brother, and both of them delighted in what they called teasing me. The boy liked to hurt me. The girl delighted in helping him trick me in a game so that so that he could make me fall or otherwise hurt myself. The girl was rough with toys, and she liked to play with the few I possessed because her toys were broken. Soon mine were broken, too, if she was able to “play” with them. In the first summer they lived next door to us neither I nor the neighbor child, had yet gone to school. In the fall my mother was thrilled that I didn’t need to walk to and from school alone since the neighbor’s aggravating little girl could walk with me so that we could be some small protection to each other. That was a hard for me, too, but it lasted through the beginning days of the first grade because my Mother took a job. </p><p>A former neighbor was a partner in a sewing shop, located very near the Square which was an intersection in the middle of the city of Charlotte. Originally it was a cross road of Trade Street, which went east and west, and Tryon Street which went north and south. In the center of that crossing stood a small wooden Court House where many important decisions about our town were made. As the town grew, the court house became increasingly inadequate, and it was decided to build a new one with more grandeur and space. The location of the existing building was called “The Square”. Two roads met there—Trade Street which extended beyond the square in an easterly direction on one side and a westerly direction on the opposite one, as well as Tryon Street on which traffic moving either north or south could travel. In the meantime, other buildings had been built near the square, and there was no longer space for a spacious City Hall without pulling down those recently completed large buildings. It was decided to choose a different location, and so a spacious Courthouse as well as a City Hall were built on East Trade Street a few city blocks from the original wooden building. The intersection of the two original roads in the town crossed each other, and where the first Court House was located. Eventually the Court House required more space and it was relocated about half a mile away on East Trade Street. The name the town citizens had given the area stuck, and that intersection was still called “The Square.” was . Rather suddenly my situation did change. I insisted that I needed to walk to school alone each morning, and my afternoon walk now turned in a journey to my mother sewing shop—a different path, and I was forbidden even to go into my empty house when I was released from school. Instead, I left school and walked eleven city blocks to the Sewing Shop and stayed there until Mother’s shop closed when we could walk home together. </p><p>Once I was in school my mother took a job as a seamstress. A former neighbor whom I called Mrs. King had set up a sewing shop with another lady as her partner. They had a nice shop and a clientele. Mrs. King’s partner wanted to retire, and so my mother became her partner, and the sign on the window of the room where they worked read: King and Yandle Sewing Shop. I was six and a half years old, and </p><p>The Southern States had suffered from the Depression which began in 1929. The Northern sections of America had grown in population, and in industry, much faster than the Southern sections. The South was mostly farming country, with few Cities, while the North seemed bigger as well as more heavily populated than in the South, with factories and mills, as well as farms. The South had a bunch of cotton gins, but their population had suffered greatly from the War Between the States. The Plantations and their fields were where the riches lay, and after the War there were no workers to plant, and harvest those fields. The former Confederacy was shattered when there were no slaves to work their fields. Many farms and estates had been mortgaged to fund the Civil War and furnish their army with uniforms and arms. These homes and plantations were lost when the battles were lost. Former slaves, who were freed by the government had no jobs, no shelter, and rarely had a change of clothing. The worst problem for them came at once—no food or shelter. Young, old, sick or well, they were on their own, without extra clothing, food, or homes. </p><p>These were very sad times</p><p>In the South there was little, if any, actual help from the government. Hungry, frightened, without shelter, what had seemed to be a wonderful victory, and a wonderful release for them became a nightmare with no shelter, no food, only the clothes they were wearing, , except for the real facts. They had no jobs, no homes, no food, no clothes, no shoes, no education, no medical treatment, and no hope. Former owners were, in their position, to be avoided, and they had no place to live, no food to eat. If their clothing was torn there was no replacement, most of them were barefooted. They could pillage the plantations, but once their first effort to fill their needs was done, there was very little left, either for them or for their former owners. could not or would no help them.

As slave sit all who were now despised by their former owners, and angry themselves at being homeless and without money . Set free without jobs or homes, without food or shelter, without protectors, , and because they had themselves financed the war, there was very little value in their large plantations—they no longer had slaves to work the land, and since they had financed the war themselves, no money to pay workers. There were hungry and angry former slaves running free, and taking what they wanted or needed wherever they could find it. farms. use without slaves there was no one to work the land. Therefore there was no cotton, nor any other produce to sell. many plantations and farms did not —financially, as well as, and though there had been rich landowners before the conflict, there were few who were not devastated by the outcome of the war. , and the way of life in the South was devastated in some areas, less so in other sections. There were fewer people in the South who had steady income and large farms. There were fewer cities with factories in the South, which had been thrive , and there were larger cities in the North than in the . There were fewer people in the South, and fewer mills and factories in the South than in the North. , and a great many more farmers. Small farms were not usually a money making business, but it was a sturdy way of life, producing food in their fields, and eggs and ham and bacon as well as beef from their animals. Farming was not generally a way to get rich, but it was a pleasant life when no droughts or bugs ruined the fields and no diseases struck the livestock. needing more houses, more automobiles, more food, more towns, more transportation, I was born in 1931.

We played together, mostly because there were no other children exactly our age (five or six years old) living near us. , who had two children, a boy and a girl who was my age, We were still living in that house when my sister married Harry May. There was a house just across the street from ours that had been divided into two “apartments.” Harry and Ella Cornelia rented the smaller space, and lived there for about five years before they bought their own dwelling. They had privacy, but they also had family very close. This was a time when World War II was over, an age one of them a sort of My family was still living in that house when I married.

The length of the side of that house, front to back, was on Eleventh streeetOn that day I walked alone a little further than one city block to our neighborhood church where the evening services were being held. It was nearly dark when I walked home.Like most Americans I listened to the radio news about the attack on Pearl Harbor. I had been listening to reports from England about the bombing of England and the fighting in Europe. I was frightened, of course, and I remember asking if bombers were going to drop bombs on Charlotte. My father assured me that we would have plenty of notice if such a thing was going to happen, and it probably wouldn’t happen at all. After Christmas when we went back to school my teacher handed out letters to parents of their students, and they asked parents to indicate whether or not they could house children from the Atlantic Coastal area in the event that area would be attacked by enemy bombers. My mother said yes—we could take six. </p><hr/><p>After my graduation from high school I went to Queens College, and graduated in four years. School was in session about nine months out of the twelve, and I worked every summer to earn pocket money for the next school year. Ella Cornelia embarked on her “adult” life straight out of High School. Remember that World War II had just begun. Physicians and nurses were in demand on military posts all over the country. This was a real dilemma for hospitals all over the country. Nurses were suddenly in demand at the local hospitals all over the country. The quickest solution was volunteers who could take over some of the menial tasks, like delivering meals to patients, holding bed pans, and filling water glasses. There were often, I am sure, eventually more important duties for the quite wonderful young people who took special training and then regularly put on their pale blue denim sleeveless uniforms worn over white blouses with Red Cross patches to serve as helpers to the nurses who were over-worked. The young volunteers were unpaid, but greatly appreciated. </p><p>Though Ella Cornelia did try Lees McCrae College from September through December in 1942, she didn’t like it. Somehow, with the war escalating, going back to school seemed unimportant to her. The world was at war, and she had been doing highly worthwhile things as a Nurses Aid. Spending her time reading text books seemed useless under these circumstances. She came home at Christmas, and didn’t go back to school. </p><p>job in a doctor’s office shortly after she put her college education aside. Later she worked for at least two physicians, and eventually went to work in the X-ray department of Memorial Hospital. She was working there when she got married. </p><p>She graduated in 1942—just months after the beginning of World War II. I think one reason she didn’t like college was that almost as soon as World War II began the entire United States changed what it was doing, and how it was doing it. The last time a full army was needed was in 1918. During the peaceful interlude between those wars there was a nominal army, a nominal navy, and a nominal marine corp. They were not very visible. At the age of six or seven I had never seen a soldier, though I knew my Dad had served as a sailor about the time of the First World War, however, he was not on a battleship. </p><p>When I started college I was fascinated at what I was learning. and embarked on her “adult” life before I was out of high school. She helped me in countless ways as I was growing up. Ella Cornelia was old enough in 1942 to take a course at Memorial Hospital that made her a volunteer Nurses Aide. A great number of nurses went into the armed services, leaving many hospitals all over the country short of nurses, and young women volunteers pitched in to help with the menial duties of nursing in the Charlotte hospitals so that trained nurses could handle those duties that could mean, quite literally, life or death for patients who needed such care. The Nurses Aids were volunteers, and scantly trained, and they received no salaries. </p><p>I envied her the opportunity to help with the war effort. I wanted to help, too, but the most important thing I could do was to make sure that any empty tin can was rinsed and flattened, and taken to school to be put into a special box to be recycled. Food tins were so difficult to get that many food manufacturers began to sell “canned” foods in glass jars. I remember that my mother “spent” some of our precious food ration stamps to buy a jar of fruit cocktail for a special meal. A street near our home had recently been repaved, but it had been roughly done because of shortages of materials. As she crossed that street she stumped her toe on an uneven space of the new pavement and dropped her large double armful of groceries, breaking the glass jar that held the fruit cocktail. That, of course, was the end of that! I remember that she wept, not because she fell and bruised and scraped her knees on the rough new pavement, and not because she ruined her nylon stockings, but because she had lost the fruit cocktail which could not be replaced. </p><p>Even though the “Great Depression” was ten or more years behind us when World War II began, there was the fact that a lot of people still found it difficult to feed their families. The depression had been the beginning of folks loosing their jobs, and ten years after that fact there were many families still struggling to put food on their table. Movies were popular and I remember “Snow White” with the little dwarfs, and the happy song they sang: “Hi Ho, Hi Ho, It’s off to work we go” and I remembered how people would laugh and cheerfully borrow their tune to sing “I owe, I owe, so off to work I go” and though they smiled, they meant to imply that it was not always pleasant. </p><p>The Depression had lingered in parts of the United States—but the Depression was over when the War began. Suddenly well paying jobs were available. The armed forces were inducting young men and young women as well, aged eighteen and older for training. After the close of the First World War many military posts were abandoned. Now they were building new, modern posts for all the services: Army, Navy, Marine, and Air Force training stations were being built or refurbished as most of the existing military or navel posts were in disrepair or simply too out of date to be effective. Immediate housing was needed to shelter the new recruits who were enlisting across all of America. Forts and Naval bases that were abandoned after the 1918 war were inadequate and out of date. Airfields and Naval bases had to be reopened or built from scratch. Forts for training had to be built. The newly inducted servicemen needed uniforms, beds, weapons, and daily meals as well as shelter. Factories were overwhelmed with orders to supply these demands. Munitions factories became busy. Clothing factories made uniforms. Shoes, boots, and other footwear were being made. Workers in factories making munitions, or uniforms were suddenly working over-time. Contractors who were building new military bases were working overtime to complete their jobs.<strong><em>*</em></strong>** Some recreation sites such as lots of hotels along a beach were forts filled with barracks to house thousands of young men training for training soldiers, building ships, submarines, air planes and making munitions provided lots of jobs. It was Boom time. Mills were busy making uniforms and tents. Factories were making uniforms and shoes for the armed services, and beds, lockers. Barracks had to be built then there were larger needed to make uniforms and boots, as well as tents and beds and lockers for soldiers, and there manufacturers were needed to build air planes, battle tanks, weapons, and other hardware used by soldiers and sailors and marines. There were not enough Military Posts to train the great number of soldiers that would be required. Someone had to build new army posts. Young men had to train as soldiers. Therefore new ones had to be built, and old ones refurbished. Hotels built for tourists at beaches could offer both space for training and beds for sleeping and so they were put to that use. Builders were needed to build, and painters were needed to paint the new buildings. Manufacturers had orders for their products. Young men and women were called into the army, navy and air force, and that meant there were fewer replacements for retirees and huge market for workers who enlisted in the services. To the surprise of many, old people took up menial jobs so that the stronger ones could work in more demanding jobs. The losses of the depression years were definitely over.</p><p>The energy and the efforts poured into preparing for war brought significant changes. The tools of war were weapons, machines, tanks, air planes, guns, trucks, jeeps, weapons, tents, and not the least—food for the troops, and utensils for them to eat with. In the civilian world clothing, shoes, and food was less plentiful. <strong><em>*</em></strong><strong>. When the war ceased and the enlisted men and women came home time itself seemed to change. Peace was not actually peaceful in the beginning. There were too many empty chairs, waiting for family members to return home from military service. There were those who lost their lives, and would never return. There were wounded men who Not only because there were empty chairs in many homes—but because the needs and requirements of mounting a war had revealed gaps in knowledge that bright inventors and scientists worked hard to fill. Medicines called antibiotics were discovered and used, new gadgets were invented making work easier, and a burgeoning economy and communication breakthroughs made spreading ideas from coast to coast much easier. Electricity which before the war was available only in large cities had spread over the United States, and all over the world. Then machines that were scarce during the war and used for the military or for other specific uses suddenly could be bought for home use. They were welcomed, bought, and used. Work, especially tedious work began to be easier in a great many situations. Soldiers came home and found jobs. There had been many inventions developed during the years of the war that had been used only by the Military, however, now they time that were time and effort savers were released for use by all </strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em> ade work easier for people were invented and used, and improved, and enlarged. People whose parents had reasoned that since the country was in recession they would do without things discovered that they had raised children who thought very differently. Before World War II there were great numbers of citizens who did not yet have electricity in their homes. There were still families who had no access to telephones unless they went to a neighbor’s house. Small businesses still used ink and ledger books to keep track of their transactions. Now suddenly there were new inventions that had saved time, energy, and effort that had been used solely by the government or by the military. Now these devices began to pop up for use everywhere—in medicine, in machinery, in improvements of household chores, and families began to buy refrigerators to replace ice boxes. Gas or electric kitchen stoves were being bought, instead of smoking kerosene or wood stoves. Telephones for both business and home use were now available, and people had them installed. Items that had been scarce were now plentiful, and affordable. Businesses which had made materials useful to the armed services found new and eager buyers for their products. Clothing styles changed, The styles of clothing began to change when only war materials could sometimes merely , and then there were telephones were home telephones now available,re were lots of other devices. Some devices such as radios and telephones were not actually new, but more towns they were now Telephones, radios, record players, cooking stoves, floor cleaners, automatic dish washers, and other devices, most of which took only the punch of a button or the movement of a leaver to go into operation to solve one of life’s small aggravations. There were and the new sorts of machines available—such as a device that other home furnaces in homes, in transportation, and in entertainment. The devastation that was the result of the war in Europe and the Pacific had not touched the United States. Europe and Eastern countries had been devastated by the destruction of caused by bombs and the loss of lives during the conflict. Though America did not suffer all of the losses of Africa, Europe, Japan or the Islands of the Pacific, there were losses that no relief could alter: the loss of the lives of the brave young men and women who did not return from their service in military. the armed services. could never bethe loss of young and promising men and women, our homes were not destroyed nor our cities leveled by bombs. Our loss was in the lives of those young men and women who were killed in action. Our homes were not destroyed by bombs, our cities were not devastated, and we did not need to rebuild our factories or replace our streets, nor was it required that we rebuild and refurnish our homes. We were not compelled to re-invent our government, nor submit to demands of foreign governments. Our losses were mostly in the category of people—young men and women who were now gone forever, and the costs of weapons and the wages and upkeep of the armed services and but of course we some of whom left no children, and had not had time to add their ideas and inventions or their particular dreams to the future. This was the greatest lost for our country. In Europe their cities had been destroyed, and many of their promising youth perished in the conflicts. Their cities had been bombed and their infrastructure destroyed. Water sources and sources of electricity were destroyed. The devastation of their cities was not the largest problem, though it took years to rebuild. Their governments had been destroyed as well, and in many countries no one was really in charge until the victors arrived to take that responsibility. The cities where government had once ruled were often damaged or destroyed. It would take not only time, but huge amounts of money to repair the damage of the war, and replace the streets, the electricity system, the water system, transportation, and such things as post offices, hospitals, police. France, Germany, Italy, and England had been torn and ravaged by the war. Like the United States, many of the strong young men and women who fought their battles did not come home. </em></strong><strong>*</strong>*young men and women had been killed or wounded in many cities homes had been destroyed and sewage systems electricity, and clean-up of destroyed buildings and homes. ad been bombed and homes destructed, and many of their young and the strong had perished in battles, while most of America had suffered only from the loss of soldiers. The money spent on new inventions was no earning . </p><p>for inventors and . The small gold stars that were hung in the windows of homes which would never see their soldier again began to disappear as Peace lengthened. The economy was growing, medicines helped to bring sick people back into health, automobiles were being manufactured again for civilian use, telephones were being installed in every house, clothing was available in stores, and shoes were no longer rationed. Food was plentiful, and marvelous new THINGS were being offered in markets all over the country—things like electric typewriters, and newly designed radios, electric record players, along with sturdy new records that brought music into houses. Civilians could buy automobiles again. Food was plentiful. The instruments that had guided ships and airplanes could be used for peaceful enjoyments, so that television was invented and travel was much easier whether your journey was across town or across the world. One of the most marvelous new inventions was penicillin which could cure illnesses. But the practice of medicine had grown astronomically, offering cures and procedures that had never before been available. and booming, new ideas and new inventions and newly developed medicines were available making health care disappeared, but the grief did not go awayere gold star Peace did not at first seem to make up for those hardships, especially when the horrors of war were people a lot of people who had not really recovered from the depression. There was very little to spend on frivolities, not only people who might be called “poor,” but for people The working man or woman had little money to use on frivolities.<strong><em>*</em></strong>*** Radio’s were wonderful. In those days there were many people who had very little money. The radio was the source of most breaking war news. Small radios were purchased and turned on especially at the hours that news of the war was broadcast. I can remember that I actually shivered sometimes when I heard a man named Edward R. Murrow broadcast news from London. He always began by saying: “This (small pause) is London.” The German air planes were bombing London and other targets in England. Most of the news in the early days of the war was bad. It became quite terrifying when the United States entered the war. I had seen enough news reels from Europe to realize that civilians were not safe, and though my parents tried to tell me that Charlotte was not going to be bombed, I was skeptical because our school had asked it’s students to distribute letters in our neighborhoods that asked if we, or any of our neighbors, would be willing to take in children living on or near the Atlantic coast if—and that if was a frightening word—if our enemies began to bomb the cities and towns on the coast, especially where there were ship building facilities, or naval bases. The printed notice also asked families to indicate the number of children who would be welcome in their homes. When I saw that note I knew we were already crowded. There were four of us, and we lived in three rooms. We had two beds—one for Mother and Daddy, and one for me and my sister. I took my paper back to school with a note that we could take six children into our home if the need should arise. I asked her where they would sleep, and she said, “We will find a way!” She meant it, too. We had a divan (a couch) that would make a bed for two, and my mother had quilts to make pallets. Had children been compelled to vacate their homes on the coast my mother would have found a way to care for, feed, and bed down those children as if they were her own. </p><p>The only other real information about the war in both the Pacific and in Europe, since television was still only a dream in someone’s head, was from the radio. There were two stations in Charlotte, but there were reporters who were scattered all over the world who reported by radio from places over the seas. We could hear them on our radio in Charlotte. The nightly news was sacred, and no one spoke aloud during the short minutes of over-sea reports. One that we tried never to miss was the broadcast of Edward R. Murrow who was stationed in England. London was suffering a daily and nightly bombardment on London and other locations in England. German bombers flew over England destroying buildings, factories and homes, and sometimes bombs were aimed at landmarks that had stood for over a hundred years, destroying churches and famous landmarks in London and other cities. Mr. Murrow opened his report on international radio with three words: “This,” he said, in a proud and loyal, and extremely brave tone, “is London!” Then he would give his report of the damages done to London to the people of the United States. </p><p>My Dad had bought a radio as a family “Christmas Present” the year before the war began. We listened to reports in our kitchen, because that room was warm from the cooking fire. We burned coal in our heater, and kerosene in our cooking stove. The radio was placed on the kitchen table so we could all listen to the news. We had also been asked to conserve electricity, as well as fuel used to produce warmth for the winter. During most of the war we sort of lived in the kitchen, especially in the winter. We used electricity only when we needed it, and if we left a room, we clicked off the light, even if we planed to return in a few minutes. Within a few months there were civic “drills” to make sure the city could be blacked out to avoid the genuine possibility that enemy bombers could attack and accurately bomb and devastate Charlotte. </p><p>Because of the needs of the armed forces and factories that made war materials, both coal and oil became scarce. Petroleum products were rationed for automobiles, and neighbors began to form car pools and to use the bus system to reach their jobs. Every part of our lives were changed because our country was at war. There were shortages of everything. </p><p>Ration books with stamps were issued for every person in the country. Even small children had ration books allowing the purchase of foods in precise portions. The purchase of shoes required ration stamps. If a child grew out of his shoes before the allotted time for new ones it was just too bad. Gasoline was paid for by the gallon, and measured out at the pump—but you had better have the right number of ration stamps along with the price of the gas. ee, and all other foods that were imported were scarce, and sometimes difficult to find. Meat was scarce, and vegetables or other foods that were not grown in North Carolina were expensive since shipping was now more restricted because of the shortage of gasoline for transport, and the shortages caused because the military had first dibs on food, and other items needed by soldiers. shipped , and in another booklet there were Food stamps for meats, coffee, and sugar, and other items that had to be brought in by boat. Fresh vegetables were usually procured from local farmers—but foods that grew in distant places were not easy to find. Clothing that ordinarily came from overseas or had to be shipped across the country were available less often. Leather shoes were hard to get because most shoe makers were making boots for soldiers, and manufacturers of clothing were making uniforms and other necessary products for soldiers, sailors and airmen. Some items were scarce simply because the Armed Forces had first dibs—on foods, and on clothing, and automobiles, and trucks, and airplanes, and the ability to ship items from here to there. Mills stopped making pretty patterned cottons for spring dress and made uniforms, boots, coats, and bedding for soldiers. Shoes were hard to find in stores because soldiers needed boots. New cars could not be bought because the army needed Jeeps and trucks and tanks and submarines as well as boats and airplanes. New training bases were built, and because battles began immediately there was a huge need for military hospitals.<br/> There is one occasion that I remember vividly, but it needs a little bit of “setting up the scene” before it makes sense today. Once upon a time—way back in the late 1920’s and early 1930’s there was a problem in the United States. Not all, but many of the banks failed—that is they went broke. They could not return invested monies to those who had banked their savings for safe keeping. Businesses couldn’t get bank money to pay workers, and workers couldn’t pay rent, and families couldn’t buy groceries or visit doctors because they couldn’t pay for food or medications. Homes financed through banks were lost, salaries could not be paid by the businesses which couldn’t get their own money out of banks, and everybody was broke. Everybody was desperate. People who couldn’t pay their workers had to dismiss them. Businesses failed, banks failed, homes were lost, foreclosures were made, and there were very few people who were not affected by the disaster. </p><p>was broke because the banks went broke. rent for their went broke. Doctors couldn’t be paid People had no jobs, the banks could neither lend or refund invested monies, and so things were in a royal mess. left most people without jobs, money, or hope. Jobs were scarce. Groceries and needed clothing could not be paid for, and people with debts were delinquent because they had neither jobs nor money. People were turned out of their room for failure to pay rent, and ebts were was a problem in America. Our national government recognized that problem, and made a decision that liquor and were problems drunkards caused terrible troubles. They couldn’t hold a job, they beat their children and helpless wives, fought café waiters who refuled to sell them any more. Most couldn’t keep a job, beat each other, their wives, and their children. They could not hold a job, drove cars into terrible wrecks, and generally played havoc wherever they were or whatever they were doing.<br/> J No jobs, beating each other and helpless wives, children, and uninvolved persons simply because they were present when a drunkard went ballistic. Drunkards were driving cars, wandering in front of train engines, beating their wives and children, beating the owners of cafés who refused to sell more beer because of the drunkard’s condition, and demanding free liquor at gun point while drunk. It was epidemic. The federal government decided that America didn’t need all those drunks, and they banned the making of wine and beer. Of course that didn’t stop people who really wanted it. It was bootlegged, stolen, made at home, and brought in from places where it was legal. The bootleggers didn’t really go out of business—they just got more secretive. They made wine and alcoholic drinks and sold them because the use of whiskey, beer, and wines so frequently had caused countless wrecks, fights, accidents, beatings, and other ugly things, like murd When the war began it was illegal<strong>*</strong>* —as I was an eye witness—the day a soldier beat up the manager of our grocery store, and then opened his storage room, picked up a sack of sugar, dropped the correct amount of money and the coupon on the check-out counter, and left before the policemen who were summoned by telephone could arrive. Later the police visited the young soldier, but they didn’t arrest him—as the manager had hoarded—meaning he had not planned to sell the sugar to ordinary customers. He planned to sell the sugar it to bootleggers to make beer and wine. Sugar was not only scarce, but stores were to collect ration stamps as well as the cost of sugar when it was sold. That manager was going to sell all his sugar to bootleggers so they could make liquor or beer out of it. In those days it was against federal to sell alcoholic beverages. This was a national law, because in the 1920’s drunkenness was spreading like wildfire, wrecking marriages and harming children who’s father could not support the family because he was a drunk. to prevent our entire population from being turned into a bunch of drunks. to sell for a lot of money to bootleggers because Sugar was scarce, and foods that require sugar eventually became scarce, too. </p><p>During the winter we built fires in We still slept in our bedrooms, but we “lived” in only the kitchen in the winter, to diminish our use of coal, oil, and electricity. We needed fires for warmth, but we would go to bed early and listen to the radio or read a book, so we wouldn’t have to “waste” our coal or kerosene when it was not necessary. in the winter, however, both coal and oil became scarce. The Christmas before that December ere on the battle lines, and they spoke from their locations, and some were able to film battles or events during battles that could be shown in movie theaters, bringing first hand information to theaters. When I saw Jewish children and their parents being crowded into Germany’s prisons, I wept. The results of German bombing of England was also filmed, and there were moving pictures of battles on islands in the Pacific with names which I had not heard before, and I would weep when I saw the fighting, and I prayed for the soldiers. I only a little girl and I didn’t really understand the war or the reason for it. I wept when my neighbor’s only son who was in the Air Force that I had never be which showed news reels of the bombing in England, and occasional pictures taken on the battle fields of Europe, North Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The War news was usually shown before the film of the latest Hollywood offering. Fairly early in the conflict “war movies” began to show up about enlisted men and battles and dare-devils who saved the day, and improbable replays of things that had really happened. By 1942 I was old enough to go to the movies by myself or with school mates. There was one movie that had no war theme. It was the Wizard of Oz, and my mother let me go see it at the Carolina Theatre one afternoon. I liked it so well I stayed in my seat and saw it twice. When I came out of the theatre my mother was leaning against the wall—she had waited for me through that whole extra movie, because it was dark and she didn’t want me to walk home alone. </p><p>learning either as a volunteer at a local hospital during World War II, or at a job by the time I was old enough to take typing lessons, which I did in ninth grade. I also took lessons in shorthand, which was a method of writing symb Most of the girls who took typing also learned shorthand (, and studied business math. and—a way for secretaries to keep up with dictation by using symbols instead of the actual alphabet to write words. I started to school when I was six—in the year 1937. Those were years in which, in the city of Charlotte, almost all children walked to school. unless they road school buses. Most schools were built in neighborhoods where parents of young children were likely to live. Schools were built in communities where families lived. Schools where grades one through six were taught were called primary schools. I knew of only one school taught that I am sure of that taught only grades seven through nine, and that was called a “middle” school. Most of the schools therefore, in Charlotte, there were few if any school buses. School was quite different from in those days than it is now. Higher education—such as college—was often too expensive for most families. It was not until the end of World War II that there great emphasis was placed in college educations. Most colleges of pre-war were young people who were eager for college educations, and those who had served in any of the services were offered aid to achieve diplomas. Another wonderful thing that cropped up about that time was night schools that offered college classes, especially to men and women who served in the military during the war, at tuitions that were manageable, and classes that were taught in the evening as well as daytime classes, which meant that the students could work during the day, and study one or two subjects each evening.</p><p>he GI Bill which offered aid to men and women who served in the armed forces to complete college educations </p><p>When World War II began Paw-paw was certain—without doubt—that as soon as he graduated he would go into the military. That was happening all over America with every young man who was nearly 18 years old. Women were not required to enlist though many of them did. They were generally posted where they could serve behind a desk, and not often in areas where real battles would be fought. </p><p>Young men were subject to the draft soon after they became eighteen years of age. If they were still in high school they wouldn’t be called to enlist until they graduated. Many young men who knew they had no choice in the matter, and had an interest in a particular branch of service had a The tough battles in the European Theater had, for the most part, been won, but the Pacific war was far from over. Though at the time he reported for duty the battle in Europe was close to being won, the Pacific was still a deadly, active and aggressive war area, with Japan still dropping bombs on Islands, shooting down American airplanes, and engaging American soldiers into face to face fighting on some of the Pacific islands. Instead of learning how to type in high school, Paw-paw went into the Army Air Force. </p><p>Basic training was a process that forever changed the lives of most of the young men and women who entered the armed services during World War II—both men and women who served will tell you that joining on their own or being “called” to service and immediately “taught” how to be a soldier was often rough, ugly, impatient, and run by rough talking unsympathetic sergeants, many of whom seemed to have hearts and minds made of ugly concrete, especially during the early enlistments. Those who had to teach (train) all the inexperienced young men and women how to obey whether or not they wanted to obey, and to do whatever task they were given, no matter how sore their muscles were, or how brutal the task, or how dangerous it might be. One of the things they had to do was to make sure the men and women in the army didn’t think for themselves—but simply followed orders, and were particularly careful to do so, even if they were in danger from the enemy. </p><p>One college schoolmate of mine told me that when she finally had her first leave she rode the bus into a town, and then stood on a corner, staring at the bustle around her, without a single thought of what she would do next. For long weeks of training she had been told what to do, and how to do it, and on that street corner there was no one to order her to do anything. She found she no longer knew how to make decisions for herself. But this was war, with no time to waste on niceties. The enemy soldiers were already marching across borders in Europe and in China and on the islands of the sea near Japan. During a war soldiers are always in harms way. Whether or not they want to fight, they do it—they shoot, or drop bombs, or sink ships, and they obey orders. In 1942 the government simply needed able bodies—and they drafted men from every state. Some were single, fresh from high school graduation, and others were college students or working men who left jobs and families to serve in the armed services. Many enlisted immediately because Pearl Harbor was bombed by Japan. Others registered because they were required to do so, and were notified to report for duty. From every corner of the country—men who were both young and single enlisted, but mature men, married, or single, with or without children, wise or dumb, familiar with fire arms or never having touched one before—were called to report to the nearest Army Training Post. It mattered not whether the men were eager, or just willing to serve, nor did it matter if they were unwilling to serve. When the draft notification arrived it was not like the invitation to a picnic—it was a summons, and failure to appear at the appointed time could have serious consequences such as imprisonment. The number of soldiers ready for active duty increased as training progressed. However, the draft continued for the duration of the hostilities. Young men who were at least eighteen and in good health were required to register for the draft. Enlisted men who had fought actual battles were sent home as quickly as possible. Those who were not on the front lines were utilized for replacements for soldiers who had served outside the United States. over-seas who were being sent home. ement soldiersthose who registered were called to service. Some young men had medical problems that excused them from service, with a military grade of Four-F which meant that the military didn’t want that person because of that applicant’s lack of health or clear vision. Soldiers, sailors, or airmen were in good health with sound minds—it didn’t matter whether or not they wanted to enlist. Enlistment was a requirement which, if neglected, had serious consequences—like jail time. Boys of sixteen and some who were a bit younger were allowed to enlist with parental agreement, or less often, the agreement of their parole officer. . Most of the very young who were accepted into military training had non-existant homes—that is—they were delinquent or without family or headed for disaster because of situations they were helpleshome situations that were leading to were not promising because of circumstances they could not change were often allowed to in life were sad or non-existent for some reason, could enlist with parental agreement, and begin a totally different sort of life wething as ordinary as bad vision without spectacles could result in a make a man have littlee age of eighteen were expected to enlistrose quickly, the army was made up of people, and though there were a few “bad apples” in every crowd the enlisted men did a wonderful, brave job, and there were a great number of mostly young men who lost their lives doing their brave job though for a great number of men it cost them their lives. There was a larger number of young soldiers who returned home to take up their interrupted plans for life; however, they also discovered their outlook had changed by their experiences and training, and their aims and confidence in achieving was also different. They had left home as youths, but returned as adults with a plan and the perseverance to make it happen. Returning soldiers who needed training to get a well-paying job were eager to make use of higher education offered by what was called the GI Bill, which offered help with tuition for college educations. Colleges were crowded. Many of the larger cities had community colleges—schools that offered evening classes as well as daytime classes to accommodate those who worked during the day and studied at night. Trained people were needed in most jobs because the war had brought wonderful new ideas and new tools (new knowledge, new inventions), and a “boom” occurred during and after the war itself. Women had worked in factories, replacing men who were drafted into the military, and now there were quite wonderful machines to use in farming, in hauling materials from factories to markets, airplanes offered a new way to move about the world. New inventions and new processes that were useful in the war could be used for civilian needs.<br/> 8888888888888888 , such a microwave cooking, could be manufactured and used all over the nation—not just in on a military base. education Most of them made use of the education and schooling that the GI Bill offered. Some young men and women didn’t change much, and were still like their younger selves, but now they had goals, and reached them. </p><p>I was far too young (about ten years old) when the war began, to realize what the word “war” meant. Of course, as events occurred, I learned that men and women who went to war did not always return. The families of young men who entered any of the services placed little flags of blue and white with a star in the center. This indicated that a member of that family had gone to war. When the soldier was lost in action the family would replace the blue and white flag with a gold star. The family home directly across the street from our house placed a gold flag in their window when their son’s plane went down over France. </p><p>In the United States there were shortages of gasoline, food, automobiles, and coal during the years of World War II. Everyone had a “ration book,” even children. Scarce items could be bought—canned food, meats, shoes, some clothing, only if you had ration coupons. Women could no longer expect to find silk stockings (from China) to be available. Another item that was scarce was sugar (from Cuba). Meat for the table became not only expensive, it was often unavailable. Suddenly there were no new automobiles—the factories were making military vehicles. There were few new shoes—the shoemakers were making military boots. Doctors and nurses left their “safe” offices in towns and cities to be close to soldiers wounded in battles. Most citizens were glad they were where they could help wounded soldiers—but the parents of babies or young children were appalled because doctors were suddenly in short supply as they too went to war. Near the battlefields of Europe or on Pacific Islands or naval vessels the doctors and nurses set up hospitals near battlegrounds to care for the wounded and dieing, usually very close to the fighting. The sacrifices made by the doctors and nurses who served so close to the battle areas was not only unselfish, but placed them in unsafe areas. Within the United States their departure from the hospitals at home left some areas of the country extremely short of competent physicians—a hardship for everyone. Gasoline—then as now mostly coming from the Eastern part of the planet—was rationed, reducing the ability to drive automobiles. The “carpool” was invented of necessity. People walked to work if possible, or rode busses or streetcars; however if there was no public transportation, neighbors “car pooled” which meant that they took turns driving, and neighbors rode to work, taking turns being the chauffeur of the neighborhood. Those who had no car walked or rode a bus. </p><p>All items that came in on trains or trucks were at times difficult to find in stores. There were fewer goods in the major department stores. In grocery stores there was some lack of fresh foods, particularly meats. The very scarcity of food made prices rise. Because railroads and truck traffic was being heavily used by the armed services even transportation of civilian goods was often sparse. Manufactured goods such as clothing, shoes, and furniture were difficult to find. One small point was the silk stockings from China that almost all women wore as their “best” garb. During the war they were extremely scarce or non existent. Rayon stockings were not endeared by most women for they would bag around their ankles, and the seam that should be straight on the back of their legs would shift into crookedness. One of the greatest boons when the war ended was that a new kind of fabric, called nylon, had been invented to make parachutes for the soldiers. It was only after the war that the material could be for used for stockings==thus the nylon hosery was born. they could be used for stockings. There were no new automobiles for civilians, but if there had been, there was no gas to run them because gas was very scarce, and rationed. Auto owners had to surrender coupons in order to buy gas. No coupons—no gas. </p><hr/><p>My Dad had access to fuel stamps because our home was in Charlotte, though his jobs were often on the coast, and also because most painting contractors did not have the very special equipment to paint the tanks—which my Dad “invented” in order to paint the tanks. He and the men who worked for him usually found a rooming house—a house which furnished a bed and meals—near his jobs in the distant towns where he worked. He and his helpers worked long hours, and had few days off—often working even on Sunday. Some years before the war began workers in coal mines and other large industries began to form unions, and threatened to simply stop coming to work to force owners of the industries to offer safer work places, and decent wages. The United States government had laid down rules meant to protect workers from being obliged to work for ten or twelve long hours without increased pay—rules that did not exist when mills and other modern manufacturers first appeared. When cotton mills were first built children as young as five years old worked for ten of twelve hours for six days a week sweeping the floors of the mills. I know this is true because one of my Daddy’s cousins, only about fourteen years old, married a ten year old girl who had worked in a mill since she was five. He gallantly married her at the age of ten, and I met that couple myself when they visited my grandmother a week or so after celebrating their fortieth wedding anniversary. </p><p>My Daddy, born in 1896, saw great changes in our nation and in industries. He saw the growth of the use of automobiles rather than horse drawn conveyances, and he saw train tracks laid down and the huge engines that pulled the trains, he saw roads improved and paved, and he was aware that airplanes were being built and flown. He became an automobile mechanic before he learned to drive a car. He, with the help of his father and uncle bought rental houses so that the family could receive the rent money to help his parents, his brother, and two sisters. My grandmother was in fragile health and was blind, and during my childhood I saw the strength of my grandfather dwindle and fade until he could no longer work his fields. Uncle Eddie, my father’s only brother, suffered an injury as a youth, and was not strong, but was the only one to work the farm, as his two sisters were also frail. They owned their farm, kept chickens, cows, and a mule. Uncle Eddie did the plowing with a mule, milked the cows, chopped the wood for the stove, and brought in the buckets of water from the well. His sisters fed the chickens and picked up the eggs, kept the house, prepared the meals, and nursed their mother (my grandmother, who was blind and bed-ridden). </p><p>That was an era of the growing mechanization of our culture—with trains, automobiles, airplanes, the beginning of automobiles, the spread in the early years of modern manufacturing required ten or more hours each day for very little pay. Long hours were allowed during the war, but only if they were paid for—because people were willing to work in order to bring the soldiers from their own families home from the war. </p><p>Daddy came home only if he needed supplies available only in Charlotte. Daddy designed his special equipment himself, and it worked well for him. Of course he had a “crew” who had also worked for him when he was a house painter. . and which, without frequent painting, would rust, and spew petroleum products out on the ground. Leaks not only wasted the product, but were unsafe—risking huge fires. The use for automobiles for simply driving one person to work was not a wise use of oil.

He invented a contraption that could go around and around the tanks, and up and down from top to bottom so that the tanks could be painted quickly and thoroughly to protect them from the weather. My Daddy engineered his own tackle and boards to reach all <strong><em>*</em></strong>Many of the “tank farms” were on the coast, available to tank ships from northern Africa. Unpainted they were subject to leaks, and the waste of gasoline. Raw fuel splashing into the air and covering the ground were fire hazards. Daddy painted tanks in Charlotte, of course, but he also would spend weeks on the coast where sea-going tankers would deliver gasoline, or in other towns where fuel oil was stored. A military base was built from the ground up in a city east of Charlotte, and Daddy painted those new barracks there—it was called Camp Butler. </p><p>My sister, Ella Cornelia, was in high school. She took a special course at our local hospital, and then worked as a nurse’s aid in local hospitals because so many nurses had joined doctors and other medical personnel on ships and near battlefields to give quick and effective help to wounded soldiers. However, hospitals at home in the United States sometimes were without enough trained nurses because so many nurses had volunteered to serve overseas, or in military hospitals elsewhere.</p><p>The war did come to a close. And nurses came home when the casualties diminished.</p><hr/><p>but at Queens College I met a number of men and women who had been in the Armed Services during the war and who were now taking classes at Queens College under the GI Bill at the same time I was there. A few of the students who were enrolled while I was there were women who had also served during the war. One or two had served overseas as Army nurses, and several had been in the Women’s Army or Navy. All of these young women were eligible for assistance with their additional education, and made use of that help by enrolling in classes at Queens and many other colleges all over the country.</p><p>When I was fifteen—or maybe sixteen—I learned after the end of World War II that during the War in Europe German soldiers were captured, and there were no handy American prisons in war-torn Europe to confine the captured warriors. They were usually kept in Stockades as far away from the battlefields as they could send them. It was an awkward situation, and the American government sometimes transferred the captured soldiers to the United States and loaned them out to farmers or factories, giving them jobs to occupy their time, and providing only food and shelter in exchange for their work, plus a very small stipend for cigarettes and toiletries. In those days there was a lot of land in North Carolina used to grow both vegetables and grains and food animals for people—and many farmers were shorthanded because so many young men were in the armed forces. In some areas the captured German soldier “farmers” were assigned to farm work, and had to be guarded to prevent their escape and prevent their causing any action that would hinder the war efforts. My sister, Ella Cornelia, married one of the guards that watched over captured German soldiers. Of course, when the war ended the German soldiers were allowed to return home. </p><p>Ella Cornelia met Harry at the home of Rusty and Margaret, who had a farm almost within the City of Charlotte. The story of their farm home was important in our lives. </p><hr/><p>Long after the German Soldiers who had been placed on a farm in Charlotte were allowed to return to Germany, the Army Sergeant who had guarded them while they worked on Rusty’s farm had become a firm friend of Rusty and his family. The Sergeant was, by that time, stationed in Pennsylvania, since the war was over. In the late summer of that year Sergeant Harry came back to Charlotte to visit Rusty and his family. And thereby hangs another tale, and another story. To tell it, I must digress a bit. </p><hr/><p>During the World War II My family, (Mother, Daddy, Sister, Me) had attended a small church for some years, and Rusty and his family discovered our little church, and began to attend there, too. Rusty had a nice voice, and joined the choir; however, he did not read music, and he needed extra practice to learn the base notes of the music. Since both Ella Cornelia and I were in the choir, we invited Rusty and his wife and son to our house for a meal, and as the evening progressed, spent a little time at the piano teaching Rusty the base notes of next Sunday’s music. It worked so well, and we liked the company of the young family, and set up a regular practice every Friday night at our house. My mother and Daddy enjoyed it, too, and sometimes sang as we practiced, though they did not join the choir.</p><p>My sister and I had sung together for years, practicing mostly to sing to our blind grandmother who could no longer go to church. Our everyday chore of washing dishes at our house was boring, so we passed the time by practicing hymns in two part harmony to sing to our grandmother, and learning popular songs from the radio, too. It made the work pass quicker if we concentrated on the music. We usually had a hymn book handy, and we learned as many songs as we could, she singing soprano, and me singing alto. </p><p>Another short digression: Shortly before World War II began a new church was born on Monroe Road. It was started in a partially finished building just because an old woman wanted a Methodist Church near her house—and she had a large, three going on four generation family. There were some neighbors and a number of friends who shared her vision. I never met the lady, as she died before my family joined that church, but I knew her son and daughter-in-law, their children, and their grandchildren as well. Because of the Grandmother’s insistence, a church was born. Of course it wasn’t easy. The building was not finished well enough to serve as a meeting place, but the Waddell family helped the Great Grandmother who asked a retired Preacher to serve as the first pastor. They had prayer meetings as a beginning. Somehow floors were built, windows were installed at frequent intervals along the side walls, a platform was built, complete with pulpit, and behind the pulpit was space for a choir. Ceiling lights were was a piano, and soon the men of the church gathered to unload a piano someone had donated. before Sunday someone had donated a piano. the call to gather in sanctuary for several days as someone bought a bunch of seats from a defunct movie house. These were rows of attached chair backs complete with armrests and seats. The seats themselves could be pushed upright to allow more room for audiences to move in and out of the rows of chairs—just like a movie theatre. Because they were discards the cushions were of different colors, and were dirty and torn, however, the handy efforts of the women of the church who stretched new brown fabric hung, and the ladies of the church gathered together to clean, paint, and re-cover chairs that had once served in a now defunct movie theatre, Once the chairs were in place all that was lacking over the refurbished cushions and repainted the wooden backs of the seats, making them comfortable, clean, and new looking, the building looked more like the inside of a church everyday. Someone donated a piano, and someone else agreed to play that piano. Other people agreed to teach Sunday school, and a new church, called St. Johns Methodist Church was born, dedicated, and began to grow. Members who could sing made a small choir. A young preacher who had Graduated from College that June was appointed to the pulpit, and St. John’s Methodist Church was no longer just the dream of an old lady, but a new and growing church in a quiet neighborhood on Monroe Road. Very soon an addition was made to the church itself, and a Sunday School was born. , with a Sunday School, a small choir, a pianist, a preacher, and a growing congregation. There were two girls, sisters, who sang in the choir. would do “special music” from time to time. Their names were Ella Cornelia and Jean Yandle. ing class of that year from The Methodist Church and student at a Methodist theocollege who planned to be a minister agreed to pastor the church. a The ladies of the church found a leather-like material to cover the cushions, and matching paint to brush onto the wooden backs. Once fastened onto the floor they were as good as new, and made clean and comfortable seats. Someone had a piano in good condition that would fit into the choir loft. The retired minister who had agreed to hold the first few meetings continued to hold services until the Methodist Church assigned a newly graduated young man to this new pulpit. And so Saint John’s Methodist Church was born. </p><p>uest ministers send an appointed preacher Methodist Then one day someone so an auditorium was born. to be down the row with comfort—just like a movie theater. moveable seatswith backs that were for a pulpitfound a retired preacher to floored, windowed, electrified, painted inside and out. A retired preacher was talked into serving a short term as pastor, and someone bought a bunch of theater seats that had come out of defunct movie house. TIt was eventually named St. John’s Methodist, but it started as a non-denominational church in a ramshackle building that already stood beside Monroe Road, which had, I think, been built to protect building supplies and other construction materials. The building was constructed for usefulness—not for either beauty or convenience. There was no electricity, no running water, and no method for either heating or cooling the interior. I’m not even sure it had complete flooring to begin with, but it had walls and a roof. The building was longer than it was wide, and it had never been painted. </p><p>T. had a wood floor, lots of openings along both sides, and that it was longer than it was wide. I don’t know why it was first built, but I do know that it was quite long, and suitably wide, with winbut no running water, and not much in the way of electricity. It had a roof and walls. The old lady’s son was a builder, but he had a large family and no extra money to build his mother a church. So they made the best of things. The first few meetings were held there, and soon they were able to repair some things and put in chairs. There was no money for benches; however an old movie house was refurbishing their chairs—the same design as the ones in theaters today—but these needed reupholstering. So the women in the church bought brown plastic material and replaced the old covers on the theater chairs and the church had seats. That first summer it did not have water, nor a great many light fixtures, but eventually they had a wooden floor and a large stove in the middle of the sanctuary, as winter was on its way. Someone gave a piano, and someone built a pulpit, and an altar rail. </p><p>S omeone built a podium and acquired a pulpit, and fashioned a small choir loft. Someone donated a piano, and a bunch of people found a movie theater that was replacing its chairs—the kind that shares arm rests, just like the auditorium seats today. The women of the church put new covers on the seats, and People from the neighborhood came to worship there. In the beginning it was a small group. However the homes in the neighborhood supported the church, and many neighbors joined together to get things started. Of course they invited their friends and families. </p><p>I </p><p>My Dad was a painting contractor, and he had painted some of the buildings Mr. Waddell’s company had erected.

Actually the farm was there long before the Coliseum was built, and Rusty, Margaret, and their small son lived on that farm, and raised beef cattle and sold milk from their fifteen or twenty cows. They also raised pigs, and planted fields of food for the cattle and the pigs. In a small field near their house they also had a garden for food for their own table. They grew tomatoes and beans and squash and other vegetables. The young family worshiped at a Methodist Church that was </p><p>, and it was what farmers didSince Charlotte was surrounded by areas where they were sent to the United States and placed on farms or in factories doing jobs that, in peacetime, had been done by the soldiers who were overseas fighting the war. Therefore, the farms that needed workers could have German soldiers to do the work. </p><p>and placed on farms with nominal guards. Many American farmers had gone to war, too, causing food and labor shortages. I don’t know how candidates were chosen, but captured German soldiers were sometimes assigned to farms in the United States, and usually there were American soldiers who were the guards who made sure they did what they were told. I know about this because Usually there was a member of the United States Army who made sure the German men stayed where they were placed, and worked as they had been told to do. One of the American soldiers who became such an overseer for captives was named Harry May. He had placed German helpers on a small dairy farm just outside of Charlotte, North Carolina. Rusty and his wife, Margaret, and their small son could do more with their fields if there was help, so German prisoners of war lived and worked on his farm. Sergeant May was the overseer. </p><p>It seems that Rusty was also a member of a small church in Charlotte, where he and his wife worshiped every Sunday, and where their small son attended Sunday school. Rusty had a wonderful bass voice, and made friends with a couple of young people who also sang in the choir. Their names were Ella Cornelia and Jean Yandle, daughters of Leroy, and Minnie. The Yandle girls sang in the choir, and so did Rusty. Friendships were made, and Jean and Ella were agreed to help Rusty, who didn’t read music, learn the bass parts of the special music the choir sang each Sunday. Therefore Rusty and his wife and child were invited to dinner on Friday evenings with a special sort of private choir practice afterwards. It was fun, and greatly enhanced the rendition of the music on Sunday Morning. Friendships were formed of course. Over several months friendships grew deeper, and then the war ended, and the German farmers were allowed to go home. Nevertheless, Sergeant May still came to see Rusty and Margaret. </p><hr/><p>Thereby develops another part of the story of our family’s life. Because Sergeant May had to oversee the German workers, he often visited Rusty and Margaret, even after the German prisoners were released. On one of those days, a teenage girl had agreed to help with the farm work during school vacation. She was there when Sergeant May came. Because it was one of the nights Rusty and his family usually visited the Yandle home. It was usual, too, that Rusty and Ella Cornelia and Jean had a short lesson on the music to be sung in Church on Sunday. </p><p>ty, his wife, and small son lived just outside Charlotte, and raised cattle and corn, and wheat, and </p><p>and that left their fields, badly needed to grow food in the United Statesin Europe was near it’s end, German prisoner’s of war were being returned from the U.S. to their own homeland. As for American soldiers, Congress had offered them education, after their enlistment. As soldiers returned home they were able to enter colleges and a great many of them took advantage of the opportunity. When I went to college at Queens in Charlotte, there were several young men who were day students (not living on campus) who were taking classes at Queens. The GI Bill was in action, and many of the students at Queens had taken advantage of the government’s offer to help returning soldiers by offering to pay a part of the cost of their tuition. About that time Queens College, previously an “all girl” school, began taking day students (meaning they didn’t have dormitory rooms on the college property). One of the students who was a “day” student, as I was, had been in the Women’s Army Corp (WAC). Men could also enroll as day students, and many returned servicemen did precisely that. I often sat and talked with the former WAC who was using the GI Bill (a law that offered education to men and women who had served in the Military). That young woman and I talked a good bit. She told me that she had been a WAC during the war. I asked her about her service, and about her courses at Queens. She told me that her army experience was, at first, the most terrible experience of her life. Apparently these young women had to be taught not to think—but to follow orders. She told me that her trainers had insisted she not think—just obey. The process was brutal, and she literally forgot how to be herself. Soldiers were needed so badly on the battle lines that they had to learn to advance against bullets—whether or not they thought it would be safe.<br/> On her first leave she went into a nearby town, and discovered she was shivering. Obedience to orders had ruled her days, her hours, and her minutes, since her enlistment. The need to obey and not “think” and been so ruggedly taught that when she stood alone on a city street she felt abandoned, and actually frightened. Bereft of orders, she was alone and lost. Actually that experience was the beginning of her “comeback” to having confidence in herself. </p><p>Parents could not prevent their eighteen year old children being sent away from home and into a war. Most folks accepted it as fact that it had to be done. Many of the fathers and uncles or even grandparents of the young draftees had fought in World War I, and knew what it would be like. </p><p>In the First World War the loss of life was tremendous. The people in our country knew that the casualty rate would be high—death or loss of limbs was very possible for foot soldiers. Families who had a son, daughter, husband or father in service often put a small flag in their front window that indicated a soldier, sailor, marine, or airman from their family was in service and in danger. The Houser family across the street from our house had a son in the Air Force. Mrs. Houser had a blue star in her front window. One day the blue star was taken away and replaced by a Gold star. Her son’s plane had gone down over Europe, and his body had not been recovered. The Gold star stayed in her window for years after the War had ended. </p><p>Boys graduating from High School knew they would get a summons to appear at some army fort, or navel station, or where Marines trained, or perhaps an Air Force landing field. Soon after Paw-paw graduated from high school he was called into the Army Air Force. Young men who “signed up” to enter a service could choose which service. Those who were drafted usually went into the army. </p><p>Because Charlotte had an airfield with available land around it, Charlotte had facilities for flight training. The wide area around the airfield was suddenly covered with housing—and became an Air Base. Only people who already lived in that area were welcome on the roads that lead to buildings and houses and barracks that popped up around the base. Where there was open ground one day, on the next workers would be erecting buildings for the men, and extending runways to accommodate the huge increase in activity on the landing strips. </p><p>After the war ended my Dad did some work near the air field in Charlotte, and in the summer when our house (without air-conditioning) was extremely warm, he would ask us (Mother, Ella Cornelia, and me) if we wanted to go for a ride. If we had enough gas, Daddy would drive us out to the air port where we could watch the planes come in and take off. It was on a graveled road near the end of one of the landing strips. The planes would come in over us to land, and they would take off over us to climb into the sky and fly away to some far away location. Daddy had painted the little wooden building that served as the airport and he knew the neighborhood pretty well. We would sit there with an evening breeze blowing through our windows and listen to the roar of motors, and see the planes take off almost directly over the roof of our car, and think that it was a great privilege to be able to watch them. The only drawback there was that we sometimes had to fight mosquitoes. And my mother would always say a short prayer for the ones that lifted into the sky over the muddy little spot where we watched. She especially said prayers as the participation of America in the European War became more active</p><p>Years before the spot where we could see planes take off and land had been a sort of “Lovers Lane, where automobiles with a couple (boy and girl) would park there. Now lots of people drove out in the evenings to watch planes take off and land. It was a cool place in the evenings, as there were few trees or houses to interrupt the evening breeze. </p><p>On Weekends (both Saturday and Sunday) many of the young airmen could leave the airbase, or soldiers from other close at hand army posts would come to Charlotte, and go into the center of town hunting movies, restaurants, and other attractions, including girls to date, and take to a movie. Most of them didn’t have automobiles, so they came in busses and went back in busses, and ambled around town and ate in restaurants, attended church on Sundays, and watched movies when they could. There were a number of families who unselfishly had the money and the time to make sure that no Air Force person would have “no place to go” when they were off duty. They invited the young men to their homes for a meal, and sometimes the Airmen would stay overnight with them. There was a family on our street—Mr. and Mrs. Brady—who did that for the soldiers. They would see the young men meandering around the uptown of Charlotte, and invite them to supper, as many as three or four. Sometimes they stayed overnight, at their house, ate breakfast the next day, and went to church at Tenth Avenue Presbyterian, which was my church, too. It was just a block from my house, and the young men who ate lunches with her would often accompany the Brady’s to church. My sister was old enough to date, and when one of the young men who came to the Brady’s house asked her Daddy allowed her to go with them to a movie. I thought that was unfair—I liked movies, too, and if I couldn’t go, how did she get that privilege? The fact that she was seven years older than me didn’t really occur to me at the time. Actually, there were a number of families who would drive into town on Saturday or Sunday to look for soldiers of any service who were on leave for the week-end, and take a few of them back home with them to offer meals and “family-type” week-ends in their homes. with </p><p>Young men, still “wet behind the ears” were rushed through their training and sent to Europe to engage in ground and air fights with German forces—taking back the countries Germany or Italy had swallowed. Very large Army Air Force at bases popped up in or near cities where airfields already existed, and also in the West where the terrain was mostly flat, and not heavily occupied by towns. Florida’s hotels were used by the government to house Air Force enrollees. There were not enough Army bases to accommodate all those who enrolled in the Armed Forces. When Paw-paw was called into service after his graduation he was sent to Florida, housed in a hotel, and he went through basic training there. </p><p>He was sent to several parts of the United States, learning first one, then another part of the skill he needed. When his training was finishsed, Paw-paw was assigned, with his crew to duty on an island in the Pacific that I don’t know how to spell. When he arrived there he and his crew dug trenches as shelters, and put up tents to live in. He had been promised a new “stripe” on his uniform to go along with his first flight over enemy territory. Then he learned that the U.S had dropped atom bombs on Japan, and the war was over. </p><p>Pawpaw had been through all his training, traveled far from home into strange places, had eaten in messes where he hated the food, taken orders from people who could actually punish him if he didn’t do what they told him. He dug ditches to protect himself from natural problems, like storms and wind, and the possibility of being shot or blown up by the enemies of his country. He was an airman in the war zone. Then, after all the discomforts that young fellow had endured, the day before his crew would fly over Japan and drop bombs on the enemy the war ended. Remember that Paw-paw was still quite young. It was sort of like working very hard to clean up your room, and when it was spotless, shining, clean, and smelling good, the company came, but no one even peaked into your room—you had done all that for nothing. Paw-paw had marched, learned how to fly, wore a uniform that had to be washed and taken care of, and worn precisely perfectly, and now, the war was over. There would, therefore, not be any more increases in pay—the danger was gone. Any journeys would be about peace—he would e shooting down enemies. It was done. Paw-paw had left home when he didn’t want to leave, he had lived in places he didn’t want to be in, he had traveled half way across the world, been eaten by mosquitoes, helped take his airplane anywhere his superior officers told him to go, slept in uncomfortable beds, eaten food he didn’t like because there wasn’t anything better, washed his own clothes, and now, just as he would have gotten a raise in pay, and the experience of bombing Japan—the country that had bombed Pearl Harbor—the war was over. No more war. So Paw-paw thought his “luck” was great, but if the Japanese had waited one more day to surrender, Paw-paw would have gotten a raise in pay. So far as the young boy who grew up to be your Paw-paw was concerned, young as he was, that was a bummer. </p><p>A day or so later Paw-paw stood on that Pacific island with the name I can’t spell, and witnessed at a distance the landing of a Japanese plane. The men who had flown in it were transferred to an American plane that would shortly land on an American Carrier not far away. Once there, those men would sign the documents that would end the war—they would surrender to General McArthur. The war was over. </p><p>Paw-paw was a little miffed because he had been looking forward to a raise in both rank and pay as soon as he made his first mission over Japan. Suddenly, the fight was over—no more war. Therefore no raise in pay, and no raise in rank. Only a sort of “clean-up” crew was needed. To one so young, so far from home, it was a dismal climax to all the time he had spent away from home, learning things he would not ordinarily have had to learn, and it was all for nothing. They hadn’t really needed him. But he was stuck on that island, and had to go to Japan and do whatever somebody told him to do, but most of it was not particularly important so it was a let-down. It seemed unfair that the timing of the end of the war also prevented his pay raise and status—he would not be promoted, and he would not get a raise. </p><p>There were adventures, and travel, and a boat trip home during a typhoon, and at last he was mustered out of service. There was a train ride, then a taxi ride, and he was at home. Of course his family realized he was being released from service; however they didn’t know when, or how, or where, so the return of the Airman was a surprise. The members of the family had done that day what they did every weekday, involved with their jobs and routine. The wonderful part was that he did come home. He was there, all in one piece. </p><p>Life was very different after the close of the war. The entire world had been turning in its place, and changes had occurred. Transportation was different. Food was different. Frozen dinners had been invented. Refrigerators had improved tremendously, with most having freezers, to make their own ice. Ideas were popping up everywhere, different, exciting—food could be heated in an electric microwave, and it didn’t take hours to cook stuff—it could be done in minutes. And wonders upon wonders: there was, at last, an actual medicine that would help heal skin injuries and other illnesses. At first, only sulfur was in use on the battlefields, but then a new medicine was found, called penicillin which could prevent infections. Of course it was used on the battlefield, in field hospitals, and when production was greater than the need of the armed forces, even civilian hospitals were able to use this wonderful medicine. People new to Charlotte could, in the weeks following, finally have their telephones installed. Repairs could be made now, that were delayed because of either the scarcity of materials or the lack of people to do the work since so many young men were in the military. But the greatest difference was that all of the servicemen had seen a lot more of their own country than ever before, and most of them thought that living as if they were still in Horse and Buggy days was totally unsatisfactory. They wanted machines to do the great heavy chores. Medicine had improved by leaps and bounds—not just a tiny bit every twenty years or so. Surgery by physicians who had been on the battlefield was different, and for the most part, greatly improved. Need was the beginning, and successful tries by physicians and inventers paved the way into a very different sort of life. </p><p>Suddenly, houses without telephones had one installed. Radios were in nearly every house. Electricity was spreading quickly into areas like Pineville and other small areas around Charlotte, and other large cities, too. Even farmers who were not in a tight community could have phones. And most already had radios. Running water, instead of hiking to the spring to fetch a bucket of water, was prevalent. Few city houses were not without power. Cars and trucks that had been restricted to government use were now available for ordinary people who could pay for them. The young men and women who returned from active service wanted automobiles, too. Because some areas of the country had better plans for education than others, the areas that were behind began to catch up with areas of our country that were ahead of them. Efforts began to be made to teach every child how to read and write. Because the armed services had needed lots of nurses and doctors, there seemed to be more of them than most cities had seen before the war. The skills that had saved lives on the battlefield were brought back home and hospitals could and did do more than they had been able to accomplish before the war. Air planes were no longer “two little boards way up in the air making all that noise” but useful machines to make long journeys quickly and easily. Because train engines had been manufactured to carry war materials there were more trains, and they had more places to travel, and more travelers to carry, and more freight than they had ever expected to cart across the country and deliver. </p><p>The young men who had gone to war were a mixture of city and country and mountain and valley and lake and desert people. They saw wonders—radios, airplanes, bulldozers, tanks, weapons, and they saw dumb ideas and smart ideas, and most of them decided that the clever ideas were better. Somehow, while they were winning a war, aircraft improved, and so did automobiles, They saw wonders—radios, airplanes, bulldozers, tanks, clever plans that prevented deaths, perseverance when victory seemed impossible but wasn’t. Most of them had seen other parts of the world, and the way other people lived. Miracles had been achieved by using new weapons, new ideas, new inventions, and using or improving on ideas for new and wonderful inventions. Telephones were a marvelous way to spread information, and they were now being installed in most homes in the towns and cities. Before the war only the very rich had owned telephones. New equipment that saved time, energy, and effort had been put in place so that most homes and businesses could have telephones. The manufacture of goods for use in homes as well as automobiles could now be made instead of warplanes and ships. Young men who had once lived “down on a farm, or out in the country” had seen foreign cities, and many parts of the world, including much of the United States. Many young people had traveled the world, had seen and experienced things they would never have known about had they not gone to other countries during their service in the armed services. </p><hr/><p>Another wonderful thing was that young men who had served in the armed services could go to school, and have help from the government to pay for attending college. The need for quick ways to disperse information about the battles by radio caused local radio stations with “News Reports” to open “World News” as well as local information. Machines like air planes and radio and special vehicles or heavy equipment that could change terrain had been invented and put to use. To help the war effort there had been many inventions, and people were trained to use them. Need is the mother of invention, and scientists had found antibiotic medicines that helped wounded people heal. Physicians had gone to war also, and learned more than had ever before been known about saving lives. . , and . More young men had seen more of the world than they would have seen in fifty years had they not traveled. <strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong>**** . or introduced to different ways of life, and opportunities to “go to college” under the GI Bill, to which they were entitled to go to schoolequipment. . surroundings, always obeying persons who didn’t care whether he liked them or not. He had learned how to shoot at enemies, and drop bombs on their country. All the sweat and loneliness and food he didn’t like, and people who yelled orders to him, was for nothing. Not only that, but if he had made only one “run” against the enemy, he would have had a raise in pay, and another stripe. Since the Japanese had surrendered, he didn’t get to make that flight, and henceforth missed a rise in pay. He had been looking forward to having that raise in pay—so he was a bit ambivalent about the surrender. </p><p>He was, of course, still quite young. All the training he had received was still his. But he wouldn’t get his rise in pay….and he couldn’t go home—yet. </p><p>He was stationed in Japan for a while, living in barracks built for Japanese soldiers, or perhaps their pilots, until he accrued enough “points” to earn his discharge. He saw the devastation the atom bombs left behind them, and in his free time he went sight-seeing to some degree, but since there was no war anymore, all he really wanted to do was to go home. As soon as possible, he did. Even so, his journey home wasn’t easy, as he went by boat across the sea (during a typhoon) and then by train across America. Released from service he took a train to Charlotte—and since little was known about the procedure of leaving the service, and telephones were scarce, he didn’t tell his family he was on the way. One day he simply got on a train, and when it arrived in Charlotte, he got off. He rode a taxi to his house, and walked in, as if he had never been away. He was not the boy he had been when he left Charlotte—and he still wasn’t sure what he wanted to do with his life. But he was at home, now. He had not yet decided what to do with the rest of his life—but his Mother, Father, and Grandmother Beatty were there, and he was there and that night he slept in his own bed. </p><p>Of course, he was now a grown man—but he wasn’t a man with a plan. He had not had an option about enlisting—and life itself was not a promise during that period of history. A hideously large number of soldiers lost their lives in that war. </p><hr/><p>Paw-paw had no set plan for what he was going to “do” so far as jobs or education were concerned. He wanted—I don’t think he knew what he wanted—beyond a sort of a longing or a wistful desire to have a wife and family, a good paying job, a nice home, and perhaps a career as a pilot since air travel was rapidly growing. He had only his high school education along with some military training to rely on—but no college degree. Paw-paw had never loved school. He had held some sort of teenage job early in his youth—paper boy, and currier by bicycle—but those were “youth” jobs while in school. </p><p>The Second World War brought this old world, and especially our country, into a totally different era. Instead of horse and buggy we were pushed into futuristic air travel and special new machines that could do much more than a man with a mule. Though new tools, and engines and new ideas were not “free,” still more people did more different jobs and more people had better tools, mass produced for the most part, and available to folk who had steady jobs with nice salaries—working people. One of the most appreciated and marvelously welcomed was the jump physicians had made in dealing with wounds and injuries, and the fact that science and medicine had a great and wonderful boost when they finally found medicines that were antibiotics. Penicillin and great and wondrous protocols were invented—needs and necessities are always the mother of invention—so that medicines and protocols were invented to be used with injuries and illnesses at a time when the government was footing the bill. Science discovered antibiotics, and physicians stumbled on new protocols out of desperation when they worked on the battlefield. There were new and wonderful medical advances, mostly because the tools and medicines were improved. Once a small child wanted a toy that didn’t exist—and drew a plan of the toy—then said he had made it out of “think”. I believe that the doctors who treated the wounded were sort of like that—they were intelligent and compassionate and because the wounded were dying anyway, they were willing to risk treatments that had never before been tried. During that time, great wide leaps in medicine occurred. And once begun, they continued to a certain extent through today, when new meds and new procedures and new machines that help with human health are frequently invented. </p><p>In general, the way of life before World War II was widely and particularly different from the life we live today. The city of Charlotte had sewage lines, and water lines that came into neighborhood houses—but there were sections of Charlotte where people still drew their water from community spigots and used out-houses. Few ordinary families had telephones. When World War II began hardly anyone in our neighborhood even had a radio—most didn’t have telephones. Few bothered to walk into to town to see a “movie” and most people walked to church each Sunday. There were very few radios in homes on our street. Most of the homes I had been in did not have telephones. Rural areas such as Pineville had no electricity, and most had no running water in the house, therefore, no indoor toilets. Ice was sold by the pound from horse-drawn roofed wagons, and trolley cars were laid in the center of certain streets for public transportation. Of course, Charlotte had telephones—but only “rich” people or businesses actually had them—and of course we didn’t. There was no phone in our house at the beginning of World War II; however, soon after the war started, Daddy had a phone put in at our house. I was about eight years old. In the Pineville in 1941 most of the homes had out-houses for toilets, and bathed from a basin filled with warm water from a kettle. Many farm homes did not have electricity—neither my maternal nor my paternal grandparents had toilets or running water in their homes. How did people cope? For the evening and night time, there were chamber-pots under most beds for convenience. One of the first early morning chore in those homes was their emptying. The wicks and chimneys of kerosene lamps had to be cleaned (from soot) so they could be used when darkness fell again. Water had to be brought by the bucket full from springs or wells outside the house, and was usually used very carefully to prevent unnecessary trips to the well or spring—water is heavy, and “Jack and Jill” in the nursery rhyme who fell down and spilled out the water was not, I repeat, not, funny to folk who had to lug bucket after bucket into their homes in order to have water when it was needed. Another thing was automobiles. Automobiles were invented in the late 1800’s, but for the most part people who lived in Charlotte didn’t really have a car for every family. When I was a child our family lived on West Eleventh Street. We moved there when I was about two years old, and my parents still lived there when I was married. My Mother and Dad didn’t move away from that house until your Mother was about two years old (but that is another story). In those days the houses along our street sometimes had “driveways” beside them—but not many people on our street had an automobile. There was no parking along our street anyway, probably because in the times before automobiles were in front of nearly every house in town, people walked to work, and to neighborhood stores, or if they went into “town” near the square, they took a trolley car. </p><p>The up-town of Charlotte had five and dime stores, clothing stores, and department stores, and most of them were within a couple of blocks of the square—where Tryon and Trade streets crossed. The government buildings—the Post Office, the City Hall, and the Court House, were on Trade Street. Upon occasion in parts of Charlotte that were several miles from the Square there would be five and dime stores,—a sort of variety store where prices were low, or drug stores, which generally sold about the same kind of merchandise that most of them sell today. But the large stores, such as department stores and what we called “five and dime” stores, shoe stores, hat stores, and most of the better department stores were located within two blocks of the square, with show windows along Trade or Tryon streets. </p><p>Before my seventh birthday there were trolly tracks down the middle of Eleventh Street. There were driveways beside several of the nearby houses, and a few garages in some of the back yards, but people in our neighborhood seldom owned vehicles. They either rode a bus or walked to their jobs. We lived in a duplex—which meant that our house was like Siamese twins—our kitchen, hall, and upstairs bedroom shared a wall with their kitchen, hall, and upstairs bedroom. The house next door was a “mirrow image” of our house.<strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong>****</p><p>next door had what Mother called “an alley” beside our house. Alleys usually had openings at both ends, and driveways usually ended at a garage door, or at least a fence. Until after the War our neighborhood had few vehicles parked, either in front of, or beside of, the houses on our street. The We walked if the distance was only a mile or a mile and a half. We took the bus if it was dark, or the path was through a dangerous area, or was more than two miles long. I walked to school. I walked to Church when we attended those in our neighborhood. </p><p>My mother, when I was in First Grade, began a new “career”. She had always made the clothes my sister and I wore, as well as her own. She had known how to sew from the age of eight, when she made shirts and pants for a neighbor child who had no clothes of his own, and wanted to go to school. When I was about six years old she actually went to work for a company that recovered (as in replacing worn out fabric with new covers) furniture. I was so young that I don’t remember much about that period, but I may have been in Kindergarten while Mother was at work. Ella Cornelia had been very, very ill, and for a time no one except Mother and dear old Doctor Ashe thought she would live. There were no antibiotics. People who suffered that illness became invalids. Mother was told that if she lived, she would have heart trouble and weak lungs the rest of her life, which would be short. Minnie Parks Yandle did not give up or become slack in her concern. Mother was determined that she would live and be healthy. The only suggestion the physicians had was simply keeping her comfortable and praying—so mother did that. It was dear Dr. Ashe who drew fluid from her lungs, and offered such palliatives as were available. She also did not accept that her first born would die at about ten years old. NO! </p><p>The Garr Auditorium was a young church at that time, and was probably Pentecostal. My Dad was working at a lumber yard. The owner’s wife was a staunch believer in praying for healing. So prayers from Pineville Methodist (where the Yandle’s worshiped), and Flint Hill Baptist Church (where Aunt Ola worshiped) and Garr Auditorium, (where Daddy’s boss and his family worshipped), and folks who listened to the daily fifteen minute devotional on WBT radio lead by Mrs. Garr were asked to pray. Physicians warned that if she survived she would be an invalid.<br/> Mother said NO! But she took great and steady and prayerful care of Ella Cornelia, who did not walk or move very much for over a year. Any strain on her heart was avoided. She used a wheel chair, or was carried to the table for meals. </p><p>Ella Cornelia had suffered a terribly high temperature, and her hair had been haggled off while she was in the hospital. She was thin and weak and not allowed to walk or do anything that took more than a little energy. Water was carried to her—she didn’t get her own. She was not allowed to use her own energy to go to the table for meals—she was carried. She had lost weight so that she was skin and bones, mostly. She would look into a mirror and cry, saying something like, “I am so ugly”. Mother, of course, always encouraged her by saying “you are not ugly—stop saying that!” I thought, being a “good” sister, she might be less aggravating if I didn’t argue with her if I could help it., and so I decided it would be a good thing to sympathize with her one day when she had not been home from the hospital very long and was using a wheel chair as she was not allowed to strain her heart by walking. One day she whined about her looks since most of her hair had been chopped off unevenly while she had such high fevers. I sang her a little song which had a chorus that said, over and over again, “Poor Ugly Cornelia.” It liked it so much I sang it over and over again. She wanted to hit me, perhaps to mash me. Since she was chair-bound (forbidden to walk) she couldn’t chase me. Mother told me to stop saying that. I was possibly about four years old at the time, and since she was always the center of attention, the one everyone cared about, and I was the small person who didn’t NEED attention, even though I was as small and needy of attention as any other child, anyone could see why I didn’t like her very much. </p><p>Since I was healthy—and no one was afraid I would perish before I grew up—guess who got most or all of the adult attention. Daddy would come in, wanting to know right away how Ella Cornelia was doing. Kin folk would come to see her, sometimes bringing a small gift—but they didn’t need to see me, and there was no reason to give me a gift. I was three or four when she got sick—and she was never, in all of my childhood—pronounced as well. </p><p>Ella Cornelia was slender, pretty, had nice (even if they were home-made) clothes. She had any pair of shoes she wanted—even if Mother had to take the money for them from MY small $5.00 dime bank, and I was old enough to realize that my money was used for her pretty shoes while my cheap sandals were bought from a store my mother called “Little Belks” which was in a grungy old building on College Street where anything that wouldn’t actually sell in the main store could be sold at low prices to people who couldn’t afford to shop in “Big” Belks. That meant that somehow I wasn’t worth much in my family. Ella Cornelia was important. Jean was truly unimportant. Fortunately for us all I managed to keep my sorrow and disappointment to myself, even though the partiality, though it diminished somewhat as she recovered, never went away. </p><p>No one could say that about Ella Cornelia—her frailness was visible. I was old enough to realize that no one ever actually punished her if she said something ugly. If both of us needed “help” at the same time, I was the one who had to wait. If she wanted an ice cream cone somehow she got one; but I was “too little” to have one. For several months I was “farmed out” with kinfolk I didn’t know very well—one of them my Aunt Martha (an old maid) who delighted in following a toddling little child, jerking down my home-made panties, and pinching my butt. That was a “playtime” that really got to me, and though I couldn’t have been more than four years old, I remember it to this day. I got over being mad at her all the time, but I never did appreciate her as I did for my other aunts and uncles. During Ella Cornelia’s illness members of the family had been keeping me so Mother could be at the hospital. Most of the time someone else had been keeping me. My while she was hospitalized. and at home people told me to go play in another room. </p><hr/><p>or Ella Cornelia. The man my Dad It was a church that leaned more than a little toward believing in healing through prayer, and the pastor and his wife had a fifteen minute spot on WBT radio. Our family did not attend or even go there, but that church would pray for healing for anyone who called them—and the . People phoned them for prayer requests, and the wife of the man my dad worked for was a member of that church. re was more to her illness than that. Most of them had lung problems, and few could lead an ordinary life after that illness.

I remember that she She learned a lot there, and soon after that we had a divan in our living room (someone had ordered it recovered and then couldn’t pay for it so Mother bought it from the upholstery store.) She had stayed home with me until I started school. But when I was in first grade, she went to work in a rented room in a building on East Trade Street, owned by an old lady who was a living reminder of how life was lived fifty or more years before, and very near the square, which was the name given to the intersection at which Trade Street crossed Tryon Street. Today the Performing Arts auditorium is standing in the space where that old building stood. Across East Trade Street there was once a hotel, but it had closed and small businesses had rented a building that had become a in the place of the old Hotel that had become an office building which was the view I saw as a first grade student, there is now a rather spectacular hotel, with a fountain in a courtyard now stands). She became partners with Mrs. King who was running an established sewing shop with a partner who decided to retire. Mrs. King, who had been our neighbor at one time, offed my mother the position. The shop acquired a new seamstress, and a new name: King and Yandle Sewing Shop. That title was painted the window that looked over East Trade Street,It was painted on the window which opened on East Trade Street, in the same block that had the two major streets crossing each other: Trade Street and Tryon Street in the middle of Town. That crossing was called the Square. I had just started first grade, too young to spend the afternoon alone in an otherwise empty house on West Eleventh Street, especially since the front door lock didn’t work. Young though I was, I knew the way to the Square where the sewing shop was located, so every afternoon I left school, walked past my house (I wasn’t allowed go into our house when no one else was there), so I then followed the familiar streets to the square where Miss Sallie Davidson’s owned an old brick building on East Trade Street next to Belk’s Department Store. There I spent the afternoon in my mother’s sewing shop, making “people” of the myriad spools of thread she had collected and stored on a homemade spool holder.<br/><strong>*</strong>*88 I went there every day as soon as school was out, and all day during the summer when there was no school. There was no one at home to watch over me, and my mother didn’t think leaving me alone in a house which did not even have a front door lock. When the school year was over in the spring of the year in which I completed the third grade a terrible contagious illness began to spread from the mountains of North Carolina, and in other locations in the South. I remember that it began a few weeks before the actual planned closing of the schools for the summer—and it lasted all through the summer, because school was late opening that fall. The illness was a terrible disease called poliomyelitis. It caused its victims to become paralyzed, and some of them could not even breathe on their own because their muscles didn’t work any more. Sometimes it was only legs that were involved, and about that time Franklin Delano Roosevelt was President, and despite his handicap he had been elected President, though he used a wheel chair. The disease struck babies, children, youths, adults, and old people, and they either died, or were to some extent crippled. Some patients could no longer breathe on their own, and were stuck into a device known as an iron lung—a huge tank with a motor that helped helplessly paralyzed persons inhale and exhale. That summer was a terrible time in North Carolina. </p><p>This was an era before antibiotics. The only thing that could be used was sulfa and that didn’t help with Poliomyelitis. Remember that there were no real antibiotic medicines. An epidemic of Infantile Paralysis broke out in the mountains of North Carolina. It spread—and maimed children and sometimes adults—for most of that summer. The horror of new victims of the disease did not actually stop until cold weather began. Charlotte City officials banned children from anything that drew a crowd. No church—no movies—no parades—no gatherings—and even things like family get-togethers were canceled. Next door neighbors wouldn’t let their children play together. The disease was devastating, and there was no cure. People who had the disease either died or walked on crutches for the rest of their lives, or lay in a machine that would breathe for them since they couldn’t breathe for themselves—that was the year that iron lungs became famous. I didn’t go to the library, or to church, and entered the up-town area only when I went to the doctor, and that was as seldom as possible. My parents had learned about orthodontists—dentists who straightened and aligned teen for children whose teeth grew in crooked and out of place. I was having my teeth straightened, and I had to visit the doctor’s office about once a month. For that appointment I walked about a mile to the office, and then returned home, without going into any other store, and I was forbidden the pleasure of stopping and chatting with any friend I might come in contact with. I wasn’t allowed to ride the bus by my parents, as that would have meant sitting close to other passengers. It was about that time that my family had sent me to a dentist who would straighten my teeth. I had “tusks” sticking out under my upper lip. If I felt like laughing at anything funny I would put my hand over my mouth, because I looked like a vampire with teeth sticking out like tusks. That summer, my trips to the Orthodontist were the only times I went uptown. I couldn’t even go to the library to select books, however, Ella Cornelia could, and she chose books for me, and when I had read them she would return those and find other books she thought I would like to read. </p><p><strong>8888</strong>88<strong><em>*</em></strong><strong>*</strong>*</p><p>Here in the South we had not only trains and motorized equipment, but we had world wide radio for the first time. We had aviation rather than covered wagons—and in most places in this country the burgeoning of production and new larger and better everything changed our lives in a hurry. For instance, before and during the war we had in our kitchen area an ice-box. Some few of our neighbors had electric refrigerators, but most of the folk on our street, like my family, had ice boxes—simple cabinets with good insulation and a drain pipe to accommodate the water from the melted ice. An elderly black man our family, with respect, called “Dad” brought us a block of ice about three times a week. Now this old gentleman lived alone, , “Dad” with much respect, brought </p><p>The job market had changed. Many young soldiers had completed college before entering the services. Many had gained brand new and/or quite modern skills, and could step right into the changed life-style of towns, cities, businesses, factories, cities, farms, and offices where intelligent people and accepted all the new inventions that came out of World War II—like airplanes, caring for injured people, different ways of caring for sick folk—for instance the medical community now had medicines and serums and diagnosis tools that had never before been in use. Penicillin had been born, as well as other wonderful methods of treatment for injured people. Computers were certainly not like they are today, but the first machines that were forerunners of the computers of today were being installed in both government and business offices. Simple well thought out methods of doing many things—from making a garden, or a field, yield more of whatever had been planted, and travel as well as shipping had improved so that new protocols were being used in almost every phase of everyday life. new vessels, tru or using machines, called computers usint A great number of young men had learned needed skills while in service.

Though a good student in High School, his effort to tackle a college education miles from home, with unfamiliar teachers and students, subjects he mostly didn’t see a specific reason for, with schoolmates he had never seen before, and knowing only the one girl who joyfully immersed herself in the variations of college life on a campus that was not actually “near” home, made life difficult for him. His venture into higher education didn’t last. and he decided to go there because a girl friend was also enrolled there. After his military service which had not been either avoidable nor changeable, he didn’t expect to find unbreakable rules, or or completely where he had no choice about where he was stationed, Paw-paw discovered that he disliked being away from home; and also that he was not in a “mood” to delve into the courses he was required to master as a college student. Most of them were required subjects he had avoided in High School—and in those days students did not always have the privilege of simply choosing their curriculum. Paw-paw quickly discovered that, for him, college wasn’t pleasant. He was taking courses he didn’t like, didn’t think he would need to use in the future, didn’t see a reason for, and besides, he had an argument with his girlfriend (from Charlotte) who was also enrolled there. he didn’t want to be a college student anymore. </p><p>His father was treasurer for a long haul trucking company, and eventually Paw-paw went to work there as a “step and fetch” person for parts for truck engine repairs, and other necessary errands. Eventually he moved into the office though he didn’t really love desk work. He was working there when we met. </p><p>Over a hundred years ago Paw-Paw’s maternal Great-Grandfather Shuman had, as a young husband and father, along with other young families in his neighborhood, had a desire to establish a Methodist Church in their neighborhood on Mint Street. The Shuman’s house had a nice front porch, and neighbors who shared Grandpa and Grandma Shuman’s desire for a church in that its vision of establishing a churchso they found a retired Baptist preacher, invited neighbors to attend an impromptu church on the Shuman front porch in order to establish, and a new church was born. The group grew, a building was found to house the church, and soon a Methodist preacher was appointed to lead the new congregation.<br/> A building suitable for meeting was found while the group attending grew until it was necessary to build a new church. After that move into a larger building more years passed, and more people came to the church, and eventually Mint Street became so busy and so well traveled (with a railroad right down the center of it) that parking along the street was forbidden, and there was no space available for a parking lot. That’s when Grandfather Shuman and his fellow members decided to build a new church, further down on Mint Street. The years passed, and again it outgrew its building and parking lot. So they moved the church to East Boulevard. The church building was only about a year old when they decided enlarge their staff to include a parttime secretary who could also function as a director of Christian Education. That person turned out to be me. </p><p><strong><em>*88888888</em></strong><strong>*</strong>*</p><p>in Charlotte. It was a nice neighborhood, but there was no nearby church. Their first steps toward their goal was to find a preacher, a place to meet, and a group of equally determined folk who would help the church grow. The place they needed turned out to be Grandfather Shuman’s front porch, and the preacher was a retired Baptist who agreed to lead the services. Neighbors and friends were the congregation, and so began a new Methodist Church in Charlotte. Grandfather Shuman, his wife and family, and his friends and neighbors persevered until </p><p>Paw-paw was young, and had not found a particular or wonderful pathway for the rest of his life, partially because he had not seen a challenge that appealed strongly to him as a career, and he was certain that he would spend at least two, if not more, years in the Air Force as soon as he left high school. World War II was in full swing, and all able bodied young men were required to register for the Draft. Paw-paw wanted to join the Army Air Force, and signed up to go as soon as he graduated from High School. </p><p>Robert Erskine Beatty did enter the Army Air Force, as it was named at that time. Shortly after he graduated from High School he was called into service. He can explain better than I how things went from that event, as I don’t accurately remember all that happened. He was in the Pacific, but never participated in bombing Japan. The day before his first bombing mission, the Japanese surrendered. Eventually he was sent to Japan, and served there for the required length of time before he was eligible for discharge. </p><p>High School students had to register as soon as they graduated from High School, or if they chose, enlist before they were drafted, which allowed some choice in choosing Marine, Navy, Air Force, or Army. in full unsure of what he wanted to do, and tried college, but left before the first semester was complete. He went to school to learn how to service and repair airplanes, but discovered that a lot of returning soldiers and done the same thing. Actually jobs were not easily found, because a lot of returning service men had been wonderful soldiers, but didn’t have educations to enter the different job market that existed after World War II ended. </p><p>Paw-paw tried attending the same college as his best girl friend, but events didn’t pan out the way he expected, so he came home, took flying lessons, drove a taxi, and even took a course so that he could become an air-plane mechanic, but nothing seemed to be the perfect answer, so he finally went to work in the office of Johnson Motor Lines where his father was Treasurer of the company. </p><p>By that time his family was attending Calvary Methodist Church. And the mention of the church opens another avenue of information. The church had been formed by a group of Christians who wanted a Methodist Church in their Charlotte neighborhood. Those folks found a retired Baptist preacher, who agreed to hold services on the front porch of a man named Jake Shuman. </p><p>The church eventually grew, received a Methodist pastor, and either bought or built a small church on Church Street in Charlotte. Jake Shuman and his wife and children, as well as a number of other folk, worked until they had a well run and growing church. The area where there once was a large community of homes became a victim of the growth of Charlotte as a city. The area changed, businesses grew along the street causing more traffic and noise, and less parking space. The increase of traffic and use of automobiles d, along with the bustle of business, and eventually the city demanded that there be no parking on the street. The church suffered because of the diminished parking space, and the attendance had become larger than the sanctuary, so building had become too small to hold all the members at one time. and it was beginning to feel cramped because of the increase in the number of members. Therefore, Calvary Methodist moved into a building built expressly for them, not far from the first building. Years passed, the congregation grew, and the church itself prospered, however, the bustling area again became too “busy” for comfort, with only inconvenient parking, and was again too small to hold all the members. Another location was found, and a larger building, with large Sunday School rooms, and a nice parking area was built on West Boulevard. There was a old but decent neighborhood around it the property, and near a bus line. The street was wide and well traveled. The nearby neighborhood seemed stable and well cared for. However, the actual street on which the church would stand was quite busy, as it eventually lead to the Airport.</p><p><strong><em>*</em></strong>****this time near an older, settled neighborhood, though on a street that was rapidly becoming a major thoroughfare.

The group consisted of men and women who tried college, and a course at a special school to learn how to service and repair airplanes, took flying lessons, and in the meantime things at home changed. </p><p>His grandfather, who was a City of Charlotte policeman, died, which changed the home set-up completely. Eventually re he went to work for Johnson Motor Lines, the same trucking line where his father was Treasurer of the company. Among his first duties was to pick up materials ordered to repair the giant trucks and trailers that carried materials all up and down the Eastern Seaboard. He bought from local dealers the parts to repair the big trucks and other equipment, but eventually he worked in the office, and it must have been with a pencil because he didn’t know how to type. </p><p><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong>**He was living in a garage apartment behind a house his parents had bought. They had been living on South Boulevard in a two story house with a large basement that had once belonged to Paw-paw’s grandparents. Paw-paw’s grandfather died, and his grandmother aged to the place </p><p>Paw-paw was still living at home, and his parents had just purchased a home in a very special neighborhood along a street called Dilworth Road. Mama and Papa Beatty had lived for years in the same house as Papa Beatty’s mother, Paw-paw’s grandmother. . She had been widowed for some years, and Papa Beatty and Mama, as well as your Paw-paw, had lived in the house with her for a number of years. Grandmother Beatty’s house was on South Boulevard, just across the street from where Lance Packing Company had made crackers and chips for many years. Lance was going to move, and the neighborhood was quite old. Changes were being made from many directions, and so the Beattys moved into a nicer and much quieter neighborhood. It was not a “main” street, it was a street of expensive housing, and the people who lived there seemed to have good incomes. The mother of a movie star named Randolph Scott lived in the house on the corner. </p><p>They were members of Calvary Methodist Church, as was Paw-paw, and “Mama” moved into a “new” </p><p>When I graduated from</p><p>worked in Johnson Motor Lines after the war, as that is where his father worked. His was a desk job, and there came a time when he needed to use a typewriter. Since he couldn’t type, it was a problem. </p><p>Therefore, I dug into a box of books I had accumulated, and pulled out a manual for beginning typists. Just before I graduated from Harding High School I visited some of the teachers who had helped me earn my diploma, and my typing teacher was discarding all the typing manuals which my class used. She offered one to me, and I packed it with my other books when I moved to Paw-paw’s apartment after we were married. I think Fred was an infant at the time, and Louise was a toddler. However, each evening for a while we had typing lessons—just as my teacher taught me—on a rented electric typewriter. I was the teacher—remembering how my teacher guided me—and Paw-paw was an excellent pupil. In about three weeks he could type without looking at the keys, and so the lessons stopped, he began his new position at work, and at last there was time to play with the babies again after he came home from work. </p><p>Paw-paw used that skill until Louise was about ten years old, give or take a year or two, and then he changed jobs, and began to drive an armored car for Wells Fargo. During that time there was no need for him to use a typewriter; and therefore the skill diminished until he can’t “do” typing now. That was the early age for computers, and most of them were still key-punch machines, which were welcomed in the marketplace, but letters and such were still done with typewriters. </p><p>When Paw-paw went to work at Wells Fargo it offered several options that appealed to him. First, he could drive (and he loved to drive) almost all day. Also he went to other cities, and he had always liked to move around the countryside. Most of his day was just driving, with stops at banks along his path, both delivering and receiving scads of valuable money, guarding it’s safety, and taking valuables to the safety of a vault. He was in and out of banks all over North and South Carolina, and several times went to other states to drive new armored trucks back to Charlotte, or transporting money to someplace outside of North or South Carolina.<br/> When he left Wells Fargo he did a lot of “Guard” jobs. One was to prevent uninvited or unexpected folk from going into a place where steel bars were made—a hot, noisy, and uncomfortable place. He also worked as a guard at new building sites to protect the tools and as yet unused materials which were apt to “walk” away if unguarded. He also worked in a factory where clothing was sewn for shipment to department stores. The pay for the women who ran the machines was low, and the owners didn’t trust them. The items they sewed were sometimes small enough to be squeezed into a handbag, and Paw-paw had to look into their purses to be sure they were not carrying either finished or unfinished underwear home with them. He disliked that job so much that he finally quit it. However, the women who worked there often spent their short lunch period outside the building, and would upon occasion feed a cat or two from their lunch boxes. We got a lot of cats at our house like that. Paw-paw couldn’t stand seeing the hungry animals begging for food, so he brought home with him several cats he “discovered” who had no home. About that time we found ourselves with bunches of cats. People would drive by, see a bunch of cats, and add their unwanted cats to the number. At the end, we had thirty or forty animals to feed, keep safe, and sometimes take to the vet. Paw-paw left that place, and I thought the cat population would not continue to grow, especially after he worked at the place where they made steel rods and other steel items. However, a cat he discovered at that location apparently got too near liquid steel, and burned all the skin off her tail, leaving only the bones. She had nearly grown kittens, but her injury had to be quite painful. So we “borrowed” the cat long enough to have her tail removed by the vet, and gave her antibiotics for a while, and then returned her to her young brood. When Paw-paw left that job the cat was still running around, minus her tail, but seemed happy with her situation. I think the men who worked there fed them from their lunch pails. </p><p>His job there was sort of like a guard job, and when he decided he had enjoyed that job enough, and sought another one, he continued as a guard. <br/> or other valuable paper from one place to another He drove over North Carolina and South Carolina to large cities and small towns or to wide places along the road where there was a bank. He carried a weapon, and the only time he was present when one was fired while he was on the job (apart from practice on the firing range) was in a small mountain town in North Carolina. The “guard” who was holding a shotgun while Paw-paw placed money in the armored car, was a little tense. He, by accident, pulled the trigger—thankfully the barrel was pointed up—and both of them quickly locked up their truck, jumped inside of it, and left the scene. No one was hurt, but that year Paw-paw, who was “in charge” of that particular three man team, didn’t get his “perfect” bonus because that moment of carelessness by his co-worker was reported to his boss. Paw-paw didn’t pull the trigger, but he was “in charge” of that run, so he also suffered from that moment of carelessness. <br/> When he left Wells Fargo he did a lot of “Guard” jobs. One was to prevent uninvited or unexpected folk from going into a place where steel bars were made—a hot, noisy, and uncomfortable place. He also worked as a guard at new building sites to protect the tools and as yet unused materials which were apt to “walk” away if unguarded.

I think the men who worked there fed them from their lunch pails. </p><p>Paw-paw, at the age of 80 often writes notes but he doesn’t write letters now-a-days. When a response of any sort is either necessary or just courteous, he either writes a short one or two line reply, or He takes advantage of the fact that I still use the computer, and therefore I have become the “communicator” person. Once we were married, he seldom wrote anything that I could type for him. There was one period of time in Paw-paw’s life when he wrote frequent letters, and that was when he was about eighteen or nineteen, and was in the Army Air Force (as it was called then). He wrote short but frequent letters to his mother and father during his training in the U.S. and also while he was overseas. His mother kept the letters, and they still exist somewhere around here. He was on a Pacific island while serving in the Air Force when the Atomic Bomb was dropped on Japan. After he came home from the war I don’t think he wrote more than a half-dozen real letters to anyone—in all those years. He is very good at handling our bills, and he keeps track of birthdays. He makes notes about events we need remember, and always reminds me of our appointments or important dates. He is a handy person to have around—but he doesn’t do letters.</p><p>We speak to Fred and his family nearly every evening by telephone. This is possible because our cell phone does not cost us for use after about 6:00 P.M. over a large area that includes Charlotte. Unfortunately, Oregon is not one of the areas that are included in the “free” zone. </p><p>Paw-paw turned 80 years old last October. I am seventy-five. We have been married for more than fifty years. It doesn’t seem real that time has passed so quickly—wasn’t it just the other day we met and got married? However, we both feel our physical age. We are both hard of hearing and less agile than we once were, but we are blessed with general good health for the most part. As you know, Paw-Paw has no siblings, and I have but one sister. I spoke to Ella Cornelia by telephone yesterday and to Becky (her daughter) and David (her son) as well. Ella Cornelia is a little more than six years older than me. She is still in her own home, though if she feels “poorly” she spends time with Becky (her daughter) at Becky’s house. Becky is living in the fairly small house that Ella Cornelia and Harry (her husband) bought when they had only one child. Since Becky is in Charlotte she usually visits Ella Cornelia every day when she is at home. You may remember that Becky has that huge dog named Pearl. Pearl is already more than seven or eight years old. Her chin has gray in it now. Becky takes really good care of her, and when she leaves her house she always takes Pearl if possible. Pearl is a frequent visitor to Ella Cornelia on most days. </p><p>Paw-paw and I don’t get to Charlotte very often. For us, the drive itself drains our energy. Even so, we recently spent most of a day visiting in Charlotte—just for the day. We hope to do it again soon. First we arrived mid-morning at Fred’s house, and stayed there until nearly four in the afternoon. I used most of my time playing with Chrystal’s youngest child, baby Jonathan, who is walking now, or with……well, I started to finish the sentence by saying I was talking with young Rebecca, however, one does not exactly carry on a conversation with Rebecca. One LISTENS to Rebecca. She arrived home from school, and at once she became very busy, both physically with toys and so forth, but also with a strong desire to lead all conversations. She talks a lot. Though Fred was on vacation from Sonitrol for the occasion, he was baby-sitting little Jonathan. Paul was not at home as he is spending some time at a special summer teaching place—not so much a camp as it is a campus —and I think it is in Western North Carolina, or the edge of Virginia. He seems to be doing well. Thomas and Stewart were at home, and Fred was there all day as he is on vacation for the week. However Sheryl, for some reason, though she, too, was on vacation and knew we were coming to visit, had to go to work that day. I think, she simply didn’t want to be there when we came, though I would never say such a thing to Fred Lee. She was afflicted with a disease called “The in-laws are coming and I am going.” She always manages to either be away all together, or to have an “errand” that cannot be delayed even is she has company. </p><p>We enjoyed seeing and interacting with baby Jonathan and Rebecca, Fred Lee’s kitty cats, and Fred, too. Summer and her husband and son came by, and they volunteered to go the Wendy’s and bring home food for all for lunch. They brought back plenty to eat, and we did have a great time. Fred’s cats even enjoyed it. </p><p>We left Fred’s house early enough to have a short visit with Ella Cornelia before we returned home. Since Paw-paw is eighty years old he gets tired while driving, and we didn’t want to be on the highway after dark. Age does take its toll, whether or not we like it. We didn’t stay very late in Charlotte as we both prefer to arrive home before complete dark. We also have a chore that must be done before dark because we have no electricity in our shed as yet, and our kitty-cats (the three of them) have to be fed each evening </p><p>Like most old people, Paw-paw and I have fallen into a pattern for our week, which rarely varies. Though we do not have outside jobs anymore, we do have chores. We have our three cats to take care of, and our own housework to do. I water the flowers that are planted in the front and back yards. We go to the Grocery store several times each month, and to church regularly on Sunday and Wednesday evenings. When we first arrived in Inman we went to church twice (morning and evening) each Sunday, but there came a time when it was extremely difficult to arrive on time for morning services (simply old age); however we do try to go to the evening services. We also attend a Bible study on Wednesday evenings taught by Bill Decken. Bill is not only our teacher, he is also our chiropractor, and we visit him once a week for an adjustment—me particularly. My spine gets out of alignment which causes discomfort and difficulty in movements—so I see Bill every week. He is a busy man, as he is a teacher at Sherman College which educates persons who want to become Chiropractors. In the afternoons Bill opens the office where he, himself, practices chiropractic adjustments. He is quite involved in our church (Bethel) and teaches Bible on Wednesday evenings—a class Paw-paw and I often attend. Bill is also an elected official in the church. He is married to a lovely lady who was born and raised in the Philippines, and they have three or four daughters. </p><p>Apart from Church and Bible Study, our doctor’s appointments, and our grocery shopping, we have very little to occupy our time except taking care of our house, the cats, and the task of watering plants your Mom and Dad graciously planted among our green bushes in the front yard, as well as a small plot I started last year in the back yard. Another chore that we have every day is looking after our three cats. We still have Brownboy, who came with us from Charlotte, and Grayboy—the one who made friends with Loren while he was on the front porch, and our black kitty, Little-bit-o-cat, who was so named because she was so small when someone dropped her off in our yard at 2190. They seem to be happy together, and in the winter they often curl up together to stay warm.</p><p>Our only real neighbors are your family. The small number of folks on the street where we live have been either noticeably unsocial, or noticeably the sort of people we wished would move away, and quickly. It may be that most (or some) of them actually rented on the nearby properties only until other housing became available. A few months after we settled in we watched a young couple move in below us, and the wife was expecting a child. I thought that at last we would have nice new neighbors—but it didn’t turn out that way. The young wife disliked me from the first moment. Somehow I must have angered her without realizing it—or she plain doesn’t like fat old ladies. </p><p>On the uphill side of our house there came a day when I knocked on the door to speak to the grandmother, whom I had seen on the porch occasionally. She was part of a three generation family. There was Grandma, a couple, and two children a little older than Ashley. When the Grandma open her door I was literally shocked because the nicotine smell of the house was so prominent it literally took my breath away—my allergies do not allow me to be around tobacco smoke. That was the end of that attempt to be neighborly, though I did apologize for my abruptness, and explained why I could not come in for a visit. The only critter that welcomed us in our neighborhood was the black cat that lived in the house with the smokers. It likes to be petted, but not picked up, and it meows to me. </p><p>Despite the lack of friendly neighbors except for our own kin, we have found our house very comfortable. True, two of the bedrooms are small, and Matt and Jessica don’t have much free space in their private rooms. However, the living room is there for their use, and kitchen areas are great, Jessica and Matt have full use of them. Since Paw-paw and I have our own “den” we seldom use the living room. That gives Matt and Jess a little privacy, too. They can watch what they want to see on Television, and lounge on the couch as much as they want. Jessica can play the piano whenever she wishes, and Dylan loves to come over to use the play-station. </p><p>At this time of year, of course, your mother’s home school is on vacation for the summer. During the last school year I had the privilege of reading the Little House Books to Ashley and Dylan. Many times I could enlarge on or add a description to augment the printed word. Laura Ingalls Wilder began to publish her books when I was in grammar school—I remember my third grade teacher reading those same stories to us. When I was young my parents often visited their parents in the country. I knew a lot about how people who lived on farms around Pineville. Pineville and environs was mostly a farming community, and in the first half of the Twentieth Century that area was mostly farmers. Both Pineville and Fort Mill were familiar to me since we had kinfolk living there. There were lots of differences between those towns and the city of Charlotte. Farm life, even close to Charlotte was quite “old fashioned.” None of the people I knew in Pineville or near it actually had running water or electricity in their houses. There were few tractors, as they mostly used mules to pull the plows and other equipment. I was quite old enough to know how wonderful it was when the houses my grandparents lived in were wired for electricity, and installed indoor plumbing. </p><p>Though Radio was available when I was quite young, the first radio in our house was the Christmas I was in the First Grade. I was six years old. My Mother had somehow found time to work for an upholstery company while I was at school, and she had bought a divan and an easy chair (second hand, of course, but newly re-covered with new fabric). The couch and chairs were for all of us, and she had also borrowed a radio that belonged to our upstairs neighbors who were away for Christmas, so they let us use it. The radio was plugged in and ready to entertain all of us when Ella Cornelia brought me home from a movie (which was a rare treat all by itself). Mother and Daddy had spent the time we (my sister and I) were away hauling two end tables, with matching lamps to provide light, a sofa and a chair into an empty room, and setting up things so that they would look pretty—along with a Christmas tree already lighted and decorated. That was a very special Christmas.</p><p>Charlotte was, of course, a “big” city even then, but ice was delivered in horse drawn wagons, and lots of nearby “country” folks were still coming to town in buggies and wagons. There were trucks and cars also, of course. In those days there were no bus lines—only trolly cars—that ran on rails. One evening my mother hurried me to “get ready” to go out. The next day was the first day that Charlotte would have motorized busses for transportation instead of trollys. And though it was dark outside, it was time for the last trip of the trolly that passed our house. She told me to remember—and never forget—that I rode on the last trolly car that passed our house before Charlotte began to use busses. And so we did ride out Eleventh Street to Graham to the end of the line, turned around, and came back home. It seems strange now to remember how very important the change in our city appeared to my Mother, and my Father. They both insisted that I remember this step into the future. It seems strange to me now that anyone would even be interested in this day and time that the City made such a grand hop into the future when I was about four or five years old. There was no television—few telephones in homes—and only “rich” people had automobiles and radios. Mostly we walked to places we needed to go. Airplanes were such a novelty that when we heard the motor of a plane we all ran outside to search the sky for a glimpse. I have seen great and marvelous changes in the way people live. The daily newspapers were more important than they seem to be now, because that was the method that ordinary people learned what was happening in the world, in our state, and in our city. I even remember that when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor there were neighborhood kids—those who carried News Papers in the area—who went up and down the streets yelling “Extra-Extra” with huge headlines about Pearl Harbor. In those days there were telephones and telegrams which police, fire houses, and businesses used when it was necessary to communicate quickly, but most households in our neighborhood did not have telephones. Even radios were not in every house. My grandparents in Pineville, and my aunts and uncles did not have electricity or running water in their homes. My uncle Vance had chrystal set, with headphones, but he could get only WBT, and only through the headphones. Telephones had been invented, of course, and businesses and governments had them, and rich people. But few folks who worked for a living had either an automobile or a telephone. If you wanted to advise people in other cities and states, mail or telegram was the usual way information was exchanged. </p><p>Once when I was about five years old I actually rode from my Grandfather Park’s house near Pineville to Flint Hill Baptist Church in a black topped buggy—just me and my Granddaddy Parks. It was a wonderful treat—especially since no one, not even my sister Ella Cornelia—was going to ride with us. It was just me and Granddaddy Parks all the way from his house to Flint Hill Baptist Church in a black buggy pulled by a horse named Pink. My dress was pink and my shoes were black patent leather. I had a wonderful experience that day, and treasured it. Because I was only about five years old a lot of the detail of that wonderful experience has faded from my memory. I don’t recall why Ella Cornelia didn’t come with us. When she was ten years old she was very ill, and it is possible she was not well enough for such an outing. </p><p>My grandparents were old, and unable to cope with living on their own farm, and were going to move from the home they had built themselves, with only the help of my mother, who was the only child still at home. They had lived in that house for at least fifteen or twenty years, and Grandmother had “heart trouble” and Granddaddy couldn’t cope with everything by himself. My grandparents were invited to move into the home of my mother’s sister Ola, and her husband, Vance Davis, who had no children. They lived a little more than a mile from the town of Pineville on a short stretch of Old Pineville Road that was still a dirt road in the early 1930’s. Both the Pineville Road of today and the railroad track leading into Charlotte passed near the front of Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance’s property, however their home and farm was not actually on the Highway as it is today. There was an unpaved stretch of “Old” Pineville Road <strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em>Their farm was located on a stretch of “Old Pineville Road” that had two strikes against its location when the State paved the highway. There were two rail crossings within less than two miles along that section. The solution to the problem was to re-route the highway to avoid both the bridge and the crossing at one end there was a wooden bridge, and at the other end there was a level crossing. which was , as well a short part of Old Pineville Road. Before the road was paved it waved a little to and fro as it stretched out toward Charlotte. A section of the original road bed was chopped off and rerouted to avoid building a bridge over the railroad track at one place, and also eliminating a level crossing about a mile from the bridge. I haven’t seen that location in about twenty years so I am not sure what it is like today. The original pathways of both train and horse drawn traffic, and later the more carefully laid out and paved Pineville Road that exists today, all go the same way in the same area. There are still sections of “Old Pineville Road” in use—which are paved now of course—however the section near Uncle Vance’s house has become a sort of cul de sac as part of the road was interrupted when the bridge over the railroad tracks became unsafe and was destroyed.<br/> The entry to that bit of Old Pineville Road has been changed, and I’m not sure how it is situated now, but I think the level crossing of the railroad track still exists.<br/></strong>8<strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong>*</strong> a few of them are still called “Old Pineville Road”. there several times in that ten miles from Pineville to Charlotte. Old Pineville Road was the original pathway of the highway, and it was the road crossed the rails in several places between Pineville and Charlotte. a mile long stretch of Old Pineville Road was also in front of their house. That section was the original route when the traffic was horse-drawn vehicles. When the road of paved the roadbed was moved to avoid both a building a new bridge over the railroad track and also a second crossing of the railroad at a level crossing within about another mile of the road. Pineville Road—the one laid out when only horses or horse drawn vehicles were using it. When we left Charlotte to live in South Carolina traveled mile long stretch of Old Pineville Road—and was not paved when I was quite young. Later, as I was growing up, half of that road was black-topped, because it was often used by horse drawn wagons and buggies. along the highway leading to Charlotte. . I didn’t realize that Granddaddy might be a little sad since this would be his last journey by buggy from his very own home to his church. Next Sunday he would go to church in a 1929 Ford automobile driven by Uncle Vance. From that time on Granddaddy and Grandmother would ride with them every Sunday. My mother explained so that I almost realized and sort of understood that Granddaddy and Grandmother were giving up their independence, and would not be “in charge” anymore. Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance would be good to them—but it still would not be living on their own in their familiar home which they had built together. But I do remember that I felt wonderful and important, sharing that ride in the buggy, though I didn’t know why I was chosen to ride with him. I did know that I had shared a small part of that special day with him. I do remember that I was “nice” that day, and that I behaved very well. </p><p>My father’s parents, Amos and Ella Yandle, also lived in Pineville, a little over a mile from Aunt Ola’s house. The Yandle house had Pineville Road in front of it, and their pasture ended at the railroad track , right on the “new” concrete paved Pineville Road. You may remember that the railroad between Charlotte and Pineville is not very far from the highway along the entire way. My Father’s parents also lived on a farm about a mile from the town of Pineville, and my Parks grandparents one and a fourth miles from Pineville, and about that far from where my Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance lived. The Yandle house and most of their farm was between the highway and the railroad, however there was also a large field on the other side of Pineville Road and it sometimes had watermelons and cotton on it. </p><p>Once, probably a number of years before I was born, there was an automobile race track—the very first “Speedway” in the vicinity of Charlotte, and believe it or not it was not a paved track—nor was it red dirt. It was made of wood. Richard Petty’s father raced on that “speedway” when my Dad was young. The “road” into the track—at least one of the ways to get there—was on a narrow red dirt road beside my Grandfather Yandle’s farm, and my Dad, who was at that time in his life still living at home with his parents, talked about wandering over that race track area after it had burned to ashes, and picking up some of the very large nails that had held together the boards that made the track and the building for the spectators. Only the nails had survived the fire. </p><p>The highway where my Yandle Grandparents lived was different from the place where my mother’s parents lived with my Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance Davis. When the pathway from Pineville to Charlotte was first laid out it sort of wove back and forth over the railroad track. However, when the North Carolina began paving major highways after automobiles began to multiply, the actual route of some of the roads were changed from mud to cement or asphalt, and bridges were built over creeks, rivers, and railroad crossings as well, if the crossings could not be avoided. The road between Charlotte and Pineville was first made horses either ridden or used to pull wagons or buggies. Because the roads stretching from South Carolina into Charlotte in many places paralleled the railroad, there were spots where the road and the railroad tracks were parallel to each other, and other places where the road wandered back and force over the tracks. When Piineville Road was finally paved, it was done by the State of North Carolina, with fewer railroad crossings by the roadways. </p><p>oad had been paved for a long time when I was old enough to take notice of it. However, my parents remembered that it began as a red dirt road. The railroad and the old dirt road to Charlotte were almost parallel to each other, and along paths of both of them there was an occasional crossing. the ten or fifteen miles between Charlotte and Pineville. However, there were sections along the path of the old highway where the earlier route of the roadway crossed, and within a mile or so, re-crossed the railroad tracks, and it occurred even after the road and railroad tracks entered the city limits. and a mile or so later, crossed it again. Since this was dangerous with both horse drawn vehicles and automobiles, and to a lesser extent to the trains themselves, when the State of North Carolina were paving the highway, they rerouted Pineville Road in several places to prevent cars and wagons having to cross the tracks several times. During my lifetime the road called Pineville Road had had two names. One is Pineville Road, and the other which is more narrow, Even within the city limits of Charlotte there has been both a Pineville Road, an Old Pineville Road, and a railroad track paralleling each other. </p><p>was since they didn’t usually stop quickly if they saw a buggy on the track,e newly paved highway most of the way there when the road had been rerouted there were at least two roadways plus a railroad line entering Charlotte quite close to one another. from Pineville that either almost side by side, or just a reasonable distance from each other little and in a few spots where the original path of Pineville Road was changed when it was paved, there would be three roadways—one was a train track, one was a cement paved highway, and the other was “Old Pineville Road” which might be an ordinary paved tar road, or half of the road would be tar paved, or simply layered with gravel, or inside the Charlotte City Limits, a narrow blacktop street. were three roadways going the same were that . When Pineville Road was paved with cement the road bed was re-routed in some places to avoid railroad crossings when possible. Since there were farms and houses along the original roadbed the dirt roads could not be entirely abandoned since that would limit access to houses and farms. Therefore, the cut off part of the road had have access to the new paved highway. Therefore, there were stretches of road that might have a tar surface, or be half tar and half red dirt, or since the road was rarely actually traveled, it might have half the road paved with tar, and the other side only dirt, with a few rocks scattered upon the roadway. There were several stretches farms and housing, a church, and sometimes Pineville road would connect with a short <strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong>****stretch of “Old Pineville Road” was created, with the railroad Therefore, a portion of Pineville Road was moved to avoid having to replace a bridge across the tracks not far from my Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance’s house. That made a little stretch of about a mile of “Old Pineville Road” parallel to both the railroad and the paved highway. The old bridge built over the railroad was in use until I was in college, and then the bridge became unsafe and was destroyed. The stretch of “Old” Pineville road was cut into two “dead end” stretches , and the aid out, a bridge was built over one of the low places that the railroad had leveled out for its track. About a mile further toward Charlotte it suited the railroad to move a little to the left, and that movement of the track formed a level crossing. That was sort of abandoned because the railroad crossed it twice within a mile—one place the rail was below a rickety bridge, and the other was a level crossing, on a sort of curve of the track, where terrain made it difficult to see a moving train. My Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance lived quite near the level crossing. People who lived in the area of either of the houses—Grandfather Yandle’s farmhouse or Uncle Vance and Aunt Ola’s house included, often found that the walking distance between their homes and the town of Pineville could be covered quicker on foot down the track than on the road. Many of the people who lived in that area indeed used the tracks rather than the road when walking. There are a lot of farms that , about a mile and a half from Aunt Ola’s house. From the situation of the Yandle’s farm it was possible to walk down the railroad track behind their house for a little less than a mile and find themselves in Pineville. The Yandles were farmers, and lived very quiet lives. My Grandfather Yandle once bought some property in Charlotte, and lived on the moderate income from six houses in a Negro section of Charlotte, until three of them burned down. A few years late the City of Charlotte decided to build Independence Boulevard, and the city bought the property on which the to build the Independence. Then three of the houses burned down in one night. Afterwards the property was sold to the City of Charlotte so that Independence Boulevard could be built, so they had that to live on, in addition to their farming efforts. Only my Dad and his youngest sister married when they were young, though Daddy was the only one who had children. My Aunt Martha married late in life—to a boy only four or five years older than me, and I was about twenty at the time. Martha was older than my father, and only their Pauline. Aunt Helen Martha and Allen seemed to love each other, and reported to their family that they had a wonderful marriage. My Grandmother Yandle was blind, and she was very frail, having been ill for a lot of her life. She told me once that she had never “seen” me, even when I was an infant. She had seen my sister as a small child, but not me. That household was made up of my Grandparents, one son, Eddie, and two daughters, Helen and Martha. One other daughter, Pauline, was married and was the only child other than my father that did not still live at home. Pauline was married to Henry, and they had their own house, and didn’t live with my grandparents. But Pauline and Henry did not have any children, </p><p>I was in high school when my father finally installed electricity and running water for his parents and his brother and sister who still lived at home. house. in the house that belonged to my Yandle grandparents; however, I don’t think they ever had a refrigerator as they preferred to keep their “well house” where they stored foods that needed coolness. Their house didn’t have an inside toilet until several years after I was married, and they had no running water in the kitchen until some years after I married. Eventually my Dad built them a toilet by enclosing a portion of the back porch, and at the same time they had spigot water installed in the kitchen for the first time. My uncle Eddie, my Dad’s older brother, his parents, and his oldest sister lived there most of their lives. My Aunt Pauline married when she was in her twenties, but my Aunt Martha married when she was middle aged—to my boyfriend, believe it or not. is parents, and farmed until some time after the close of World War II, and he did not have a tractor—but plowed the hard day, with a mule pulling the plow. It’s hard in this day and age to believe that people were still using kerosene lamps for lights and mules or horses rather than tractors for both plowing and traveling. But it was true. to plow with when I was a child, and a youth. Farmers in Pineville raised most of their own food, but there were a lot of people who did not have electricity or indoor plumbing as I was growing up. In Pineville water was brought from a well or spring, and toilets were outside, a short distance from the house. They cooked on wood burning stoves, spending a lot of time chopping the wood, hauling it into the house, and disposing of ashes. Their water was carried into the house by the bucket full, from a well in the yard, or a spring that was w-a-y—that means a LONG way—downhill from the house. Of course once the water was in the bucket, it was a long steep climb uphill to get to the house. </p><p>All the years when I was living at home with my parents we would, upon special occasions, go to church in the Pineville area with my Parks grandparents (my mother’s folks). They worshiped at Flint Hill Baptist Church where (during my childhood and youth) there was actually a hitching post for horse drawn transportation. And there were, in those days, a number of buggies, wagons, and saddled horses tied up there. This was a novelty for me as a little city person. Most of the time I saw horses only when the ice man delivered blocks of ice to homes on our street for the many ice boxes still in use. The more modern Refrigerators with ice making capability was not prevalent in Charlotte until after World War II. During my early childhood we used an ice box—with ice delivered in twenty-five or fifty pound blocks and stored (though it eventually melted, especially in summer) in an “ice box” that would keep milk and meat cool for short periods of storage. In our neighborhood an old—sixty or seventy years—black man toted our ice in about three times a week. The ice delivery “wagon” really was a wagon—hauled by a horse. The old man was poorly clothed, and skinny. We thought he seemed “poor”—meaning he didn’t get enough to eat, and we thought he had no close family. He LOOKED hungry, and dressed cleanly, but in the same clothes day after day. My mother took pity on him and one day asked if he had eaten breakfast—since we were busy doing just that when he came in. So my mother fixed him an egg sandwich wrapped in wax paper, and a pint of coffee in a “thermos” she fashioned from a pint glass jar wrapped in paper napkins and placed inside an empty, well washed tin can that had once been a container for fruit cocktail. She called the old man “Dad” and he was most grateful. He always handed the “thermos” jar and tin back to her, always well washed and ready the next day. All through the period of the war, “Dad” drove the horse drawn ice delivery wagon, and took his breakfast with him as he went on his way. He never missed our delivery, and my mother kept on handing out his breakfast after every delivery of the ice. When the war ended he told us one day that he was retiring, and would not be coming again, and he thanked my mother for her kindness to him. Strangely, the other times we saw horses included the coal man, who delivered fuel by the half ton to houses where coal was burned in stove or fireplace during cold weather. Upon occasion there were horse drawn wagons filled with vegetables, or melons, from small farms near Charlotte, because fresh vegetables were scarce in stores. Food in cans or jars was scarce in grocery stores, also, but we could, and did, buy vegetables from farmers who sold their bounty from wagons and trucks along the streets in Charlotte. Those men didn’t require “ration stamps” which the government distributed so that people with money couldn’t buy all the food and make life difficult for those who couldn’t pay “extra” just to get food. Within the city one could not go out and cut down a nearby tree for fuel. My uncles and aunts often had to do just that, as they lived in the country and had access to wood for making fires for the winter. In the city we used coal and oil very carefully. One had to have not only money, but a “ration” book with “stamps” that could be traded for food, coal, gasoline, shoes, and other products. If we actually bought food in tin cans, we washed the cans, took out both “ends” of the can, flattened the can itself around its “ends” and I took them to school to be deposited in a basket so that they could be recovered and melted down and used again. </p><hr/><p>All the farmers I knew or heard about were unlikely to have sent their horses or mules to the abattoir, even if they had moved up to tractors. Gasoline was so scarce that some returned to using horses, and we saw horse or mule drawn wagons on our street that were filled with vegetables or watermelons that were for sale in the neighborhoods of Charlotte. People in our neighborhood who bought regularly from passing farmers faired well in harvest time, as the farmers would return again and again into the area where they could vend their wares with some certainty. My Dad and our back-door neighbor, and two “older” families who lived across the street from us, were the families on our block of Eleventh Street who had automobiles or trucks. Almost every one either walked or rode a bus. I was six years old when streetcars stopped running along Eleventh Street and buses took over their routes. </p><p>needed to travel for several miles. Now in the early 1930’s many of our kin, and many citizens of Pineville and its environs used automobiles or trucks to travel to church. However those hitching posts at Flint Hill Baptist Church stayed there until I was in my late teens or early twenties. As I was growing up changes were inevitable. The “old” folks who looked askance at motorized equipment used horses, but their grown-up children embraced the machine-powered contraptions that made their labor easier, and each year of my life there were fewer horses traveling the streets of Charlotte. By 1942 horses were rarely seen, until the government started building war related buildings or clearing land for quickly needed buildings, or just cleared space, for instance, at or near the air port space. Builders were at times compelled to use real horses to provide their “horse power.” I was a ten years old in February of 1941 when the war began. I remember shedding tears when I saw dead horses that had, literally, been “worked to death” hauled down Graham Street dangling from wrecker trucks. </p><p>After the beginning of the War there were more automobiles and trucks everywhere. Even small farms began to grow more food than was needed for the family who owned it, as scarcity of food was one of the things that was quickly felt, especially in cities, as the war progressed. People who had a patch of ground near their homes began growing Victory Gardens because both food and transportation were difficult to achieve. Gasoline, shoes, and sugar were among the items that became subject to rationing, with little books of detachable stamps that had to be turned over to the grocery store, or in the case of other rationed items, the stamps were surrendered at the cash registers of clothing and shoe stores, like a Belk store, or wherever shoes were sold, or especially where food—groceries—were sold. Gasoline was rationed. Vegetables were scarce, and sometimes meat was unavailable. Ration stamps were furnished to all citizens, so that people who could afford to buy plenty of food could not buy up all the food, leaving people who could not hoard food without enough to eat. Canned food used metal cans and had to be transported by train or by truck, both being heavily used by the war effort. Cans used as food containers became so scarce that a lot of food suppliers went back to glass jars instead of cans. There were scarce items in cities like Charlotte. Cuba supplied most of the sugar we used, so Sugar was rationed. Meat was rationed. Charlotte was growing and expanding because of the demands of the war. Our airport was used by the Army Air Force, and portions of it were off limits to visitors. Soldiers wandered the uptown streets, especially on week-ends. A childless neighbor just across the street from our house was a little older than my parents, but she and her husband opened their home to servicemen on the week-ends, and a lot of them treated her like a much loved grandmother, and wrote to her when they were transferred, and continued after the war was over. </p><p>It was impossible to buy a “new” car, and not much easier to purchase an old one. Gas was rationed, and there was little if any “joy” riding. People walked, or took a bus to work. My Dad had more ration stamps than an “ordinary” father because he was doing paint jobs for places like Esso Standard Oil refineries, and buildings like Camp Butner, which was a military base. He was away from home a lot in those days. For a while only my mother and I were at home, as Ella Cornelia was in college. However, college did not appeal to her, and she left before the close of the first semester, and went to work in a doctor’s office in Charlotte, as a great many nurses had left their jobs at home to volunteer to work in Amy, Navy, and Marine hospitals. Doctors became scarce, and those still in practice in small cities and large ones usually had more patients than they could easily manage. </p><p>Items that had been available and plentiful at the grocery store became scarce. Most Sugar came from Cuba, and so Sugar was rationed. Table meat, like bacon, chicken, beef, and pork became scarce. Gasoline was often unavailable as more and more motorized vehicles were being used. Meat was not plentiful, Small farmers enlarged their gardens and fields if at all possible, and vegetables were sold door to door as grocery stores were more and more often without enough of their goods to serve their customers. When a new store was opened clerks were hard to find, and more and more women were used in the market-place. Women who had never worked outside their own homes donned overalls and went to work, leaving the older and/or younger folk to do the work at home. </p><p>and on small farms in the country. to work their farms. Even so, the older folk still clung to the old ways. Tractors became more likely on the larger farms where the owners were the same age, or a tad younger than my parents. My father, Leroy Yandle, spent some months at a special school, learning how to repair automobiles, and keep their motors in good running order. <strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong>* same age as my parents did have automobiles or trucks, and most of them used tractors on their farms, but some of the members of Flint Hill still traveled by horses—and my maternal grandparents were among them. </p><p>As a child I saw and experienced many events similar to those written about in the Little House books, though their “era” was much earlier than mine. Life was very different than the present. Both Paw-paw and I were born before there were any effective antibiotics. Telephones were being used by businesses, but there were few households that had telephones until after the end of World War II. I was about six years old when my parents installed a telephone in our hallway. My Dad was a painting contractor and used it for his business. Our neighbors would, upon occasion, ask to use our phone, because there were few telephones in ordinary houses. Only two families on our block had telephones before I was more than ten years old. Most homes in towns like Fort Mill and Pineville were unlikely to have telephone service. Though the business sections of the smaller towns as well as the city of Charlotte, and “rich” home owners all over the area were using them. By the time I was married (1954) most homes—though not all—had telephones. Television had been invented, but it was only black and white—not color TV when your mother was young. Only the “rich” had television sets at first. Though Paw-paw’s parents already had television when we married, my parents did not have television until after your Mother had married. </p><p>You probably have heard that my sister Ella Cornelia was not a splendidly healthy person after her tenth birthday. She had pleurisy and other illnesses when she was ten or perhaps twelve, and it damaged her heart. There were few or no effective medicines at that time. Even so, Medicine had advanced in those years beyond the practices available to people when my parent’s were young. When my father’s sister, my Aunt Helen, was a young girl some illness attacked her while she was in her teens. Her doctor—I think probably in desperation trying to help her—gave her a “medicine” that rotted her teeth out before she was eighteen. She survived the treatment and the illness, but began wearing false teeth in her late teens. </p><p>When my sister was ill at the age of ten years the best treatment for her was bed rest. </p><p>I, myself, was about twelve when the first real antibiotic, other than sulfa, was introduced. This was, of course, during World War II, and the beginning of the story about my first dose of penicillin began with my dad, a painting contractor, who painted the house of a big-wig at the Standard Oil Company in Charlotte. The oil man had two problems: one was that his wife wanted their house painted—now! And the other was that the Standard Oil tank farm had problems because their tanks were rusting and springing leaks. My Dad was quite well known in Charlotte as an excellent painting contractor. He worked from home, and had done jobs for people like Mr. and Mrs. Ivey who owned the most sophisticated department store in Charlotte, and a bunch of other important people, most of whom had fabulous homes. Therefore my dad got the job of painting the house of the top man in Charlotte for the Standard Oil Company. While Daddy was working there the home owner mentioned the rusty, leaking tanks at the oil terminal where he worked. He asked my father if he knew anything about painting the outside of huge tanks. Daddy said he would think on it. </p><p>That was a beginning. My Dad “invented” a device that would place a painter on the side of the tank at a desired level, and allow him to move horizontally around the huge tank. When the tank had been circled at that level, the worker could lower the walk board, and start around the tank again with a spray gun, covering the entire tank with a fresh coat of protective paint. The tops of those tanks were movable—that is—they floated on top of the oil, instead of hanging on to the top of the tank. If the tank was full—the “lid” was at the top of the tank. If the tank was half full then the “lid” of the tank was at the half-way mark—touching the oil, not allowing dangerous fumes to gather in tight spaces where combustion could occur. If there was even a tiny opening along the sides of filled tanks due to rust or damage, the weight of the flammable liquid would push little sprays of oil through the hole onto the ground as if it were pressurized. Of course, these little sprays could ignite if a stray cigarette was quite close to it. Therefore that job was one where you didn’t want any sort of spontaneous combustion. All during the war Daddy painted oil terminals in North and South Carolina, and in Savannah, Georgia. </p><p>All during the war Daddy painted oil terminals in both North and South Carolina, and even in the area of Savannah, Georgia. Of course this sort of job meant he was away from home for weeks at the time. That left me, my sister, and my mother without automobile transportation, as Mother did not drive. When Daddy was away we didn’t have a car anyway. The armed services had first dibs on gasoline, so oil and gas was rationed for automobiles used for daily commuting. That meant that we had to ride a bus if we needed to go further than we could walk. If we were a half mile from the grocery store we had to tote our groceries in brown paper bags. If Daddy was not in Charlotte, we stayed home on Sundays or took a bus to church. Riding the bus was expensive—each ride cost seven cents per person. </p><p>When school was out <strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong>**, and a little smaller when the , and time consuming. Daddy could not commute daily while he painted the tanks on the coast of North and South Carolina and Georgia. He was away from home for weeks at a time. There were, of course, a lot of men who were away from home serving in the armed services in those days, and my Dad and his workmen were doing what they could to protect the oil and gas those soldiers, sailors, and airmen used. </p><p>ng that job the man talked to him about a problem he had with the huge tank farms done some work bid a job in Savannah to paint the outside surfaces of the tremendous tanks that held all sorts of oil products that came in on the floating tanks of </p><p>had penicillin when I was about twelve.

Both Paw-paw and I were in were children when motorized travel was growing rapidly into our culture. Automobiles appeared in North Carolina long before I was born, but about the time when they were really in production, the “Great Depression” occurred, so that the automotive industry was at least slowed in its growth. My sister and I were part of the first generation of children to whom long journeys meant driving in a car. </p><p>My Dad had an automobile most of my life. However, when I was about five years old I actually rode to church (Flint Hill Baptist, near Pineville) in a buggy driven by my Grandfather Parks (my Mother’s father). It was a special treat for me, but it was a most important day for my grandparents. They were quite old, and had planned within the next week or so to move away from the house they had lived in for perhaps twenty-five or thirty years. Their house was built by Grandfather Parks with the help of my mother, the only one of their children still at home at that time. Even I have one vivid memory of that house. I was probably four, or possibly five years old. In those days I was quite aware that there was a phrase which ruled most houses where there were children: “Children should be seen, and not heard”. Sitting and watching grownups talk was no fun. So when it began to rain. I could hear the drops fall with a pitter-pat upon the tin roof of the house. My mother agreed that I could go out onto the front porch to watch the rain fall onto the edge of the porch making “raindrop soldiers” that were really droplet splashes on the steps and the edge of the porch. I could hear the rain ping on the tin roof as I sat upon the humped top of an old trunk set against the wall of the house. I felt blessed and entertained because of the sound of the downpour on the tin roof, and the silvery march of the droplets on the edge of the porch. I sat safe and dry on the curved top of the old trunk, and probably sang the little song about rain that I learned when I attended Kindergarten at the age of five—the same song I have sung to the children around me when a steady rain drops silvery plop-plash raindrops on porches, cars, roadways or other outdoor places. </p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">    </span><span class="err">“</span><span class="n">The</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">little</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">raindrop</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">soldiers</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">are</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">marching</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sky</span><span class="p">,</span>

Not too long ago when I was reading to Ashley and Dylan as part of their schooling I sang that song to them. The rain was thumping on our roof, and drops were splashing a silvery pattern on our deck. Apparently I hadn’t sung about raindrops for a long while, because they both peered out the large door in our dining area to watch the rain fall in tiny fountain-like circles. </p><p>As a very small child I had another wonderful experience quite close to the time I watched the rain fall on the porch of my grandparents. This was on a Sunday. My Dad owned an automobile, and I don’t remember what kind it was. I didn’t ride in it often. We were going to Pineville to see my mother’s parents, Granddaddy and Grandmother Parks. When we arrived I was informed that there was a wonderful trip ahead for me. I was going to ride to church with Granddaddy Parks—just the two of us—in a buggy behind a beautiful white horse named Pink. Pink was not really pink, of course. He was white with a few small black dots on his coat. However he was old, and his hide was thin, so that when the sun was bright, he looked pink. We were traveling to a country church—Flint Hill Baptist—located between Pineville and Fort Mill. My buggy ride was a “milestone,” not only for me, but it signified major changes in the lives of my Grandparents. The Sunday of the buggy ride was the last Sunday my Grandfather would drive his horse, “Pink” in his own buggy from his own home to the church he had attended for many years. </p><p>My grandparents were going to move the next week into the home of his daughter, Ola, and her husband Vance Davis. My grandparents were getting old. They had lived for many years in a tin roofed country farm house which had neither electricity nor running water. They were going to move into the home of my Uncle Vance and Aunt Ola (Ola was my mother’s sister) for the rest of their lives. Since it was the last time Grandfather Parks would leave his own home of many years to drive to church, he refused to ride in Uncle Vance’s 1929 Ford automobile, and chose to drive his buggy behind his horse Pink. And on that occasion—wonder of wonders—I, at the age of about four or five, and most especially only me, got to ride in the buggy with him. It was a great treat. I even remember that my dress was pink. I discovered that day that there was a cemetery off to one side of the yard of the church—which was customary in that day and time. And I learned that my mother’s youngest brother was buried there in the family plot. </p><p>I discovered that in that church men and women sat on separate sides of the church. And to my surprise my Granddaddy, because of his position within the church, sat just below the pulpit at the same level as the benches, but facing the congregation. The pulpit was mounted on a stage-like platform. Granddaddy sat there for the entire service, but during the sermon he went to sleep and snored, but no person in the church laughed. </p><p>This was the church that the entire Parks family had attended all of my mother’s life. Flint Hill Baptist Church is, so far as I know, still a going concern. In those early times when a church was founded it was customary to have a cemetery somewhere on the property where members of the church could be buried. My grandparents, as well as my uncle and aunt, are buried in the cemetery at Flint Hill. So far as I know the church is still there, though I haven’t seen in years. </p><p>Back to Now, instead of when I was a child: As for Paw-paw and me, our pattern of days has few surprises and is much the same week after week. Of course, Jessica and Matt still live in our house, and each year I have helped home school Ashley and Dylan. That has been a wonderful treat for me. They will, of course, soon be using the computer to complete their studies, but so long as I can be of help, I will joyfully read to the children—which has been my task for the most part. After school Ashley and Dylan usually stop by Paw-paw’s room to choose a treat, or get paid for bringing in our mail, as he, too, enjoys seeing them and interacting with them often.</p><p>Sundays and Wednesdays are church days, and we usually go to the evening meetings on both days. I still need allergy shots every three weeks on Mondays and we try to see our chiropractor at least once every week. The only people we know here in South Carolina are fellow church members and the physicians we visit. Though I tried to make friends with some of the people who live on our street, I haven’t been successful in that endeavor. I went to the house next door to us (the up-hill one) soon after we moved in, and when the door opened I discovered that the house was so full of cigarette smoke I couldn’t even stand in the doorway. I was embarrassed because I had to back out of the door as my allergies are extremely sensitive to cigarette smoke. I did explain to the lady who came to the door, and even apologized to her, but she made no effort to be friendly towards me. The lady and her grandchildren were the only ones at home during the day, and were our nearest neighbor. The children were about ten and twelve years old, and they played in their yard in the afternoons, but strangely they didn’t reach out to Dylan and Ashley. Since I couldn’t go to her house that quick exit on my part was the end of all efforts to make friends, and I have found it strange that none of the folks who lived here before we moved in made any effort to be friendly or neighborly. Therefore, the Beatty and Bingham households were the only familiar ones. </p><p>Some of the folks that lived here when we first moved in have already moved away. Other folks have moved in, stayed about two or three months, and then moved out. None of the people who live near us is very eager to become friendly. In most instances we don’t even swap “howdys” since they ignore us. </p><p>The people who live next to our house on the down-hill side are young folks. I thought I would be nice and we could become neighbors. The wife was pregnant when they moved in, and when their child was born we took to them a small gift for the child. The mother did open the gift, and did say thank you, but we were not made really welcome, nor offered a seat in their living room. Therefore, we left fairly quickly. They had not been in the house very long when their child was born. They did have a large dog which was quite friendly. The dog developed a limp, and some one of her neighbors (not us) called the Humane Society, and they made Missy, our neighbor, put her dog to sleep. She accused me of calling the Humane Society and told me to stay out of her yard and leave her alone. Therefore, I am reluctant to even speak to her, though sometimes I try. The funny thing is that she will talk to Pawpaw, and smile at him, and if he calls me over, she is “nice” to me, but she never, never, makes any effort to speak to me if I am alone. I often wonder if her head is screwed on tight. </p><p>Ella Cornelia seems to be doing O.K. I haven’t seen her lately but we talk upon occasion by phone. I want to go spend the day with her soon. I’ve done that several times since we have been living in South Carolina. She spent a several days with me while we were living at the big old house on Highway 9. It was great to have her there. </p><p>There is a “happening” I would like to tell you about, simply because it is a little unusual. When your mother was still in school we went for a drive one Sunday afternoon. I don’t recall that Fred was with us on this occasion. I think your mother was still in college. We stopped at the home of my Aunt Ola. By that time she and her husband Vance were living alone as my grandparents had passed away. I think that by that time they had electricity and running water in their home. </p><p>When I was about eight years old my Grandmother Parks suffered a heart attack and died, but Grandfather seemed to be very strong and healthy. He chose as his particular chore the oversight of a young cow, and was feeding it grasses to wean it from its mother’s milk. On a sunny and pleasant afternoon he volunteered to walk down Old Pineville Road to collect the mail from the mailbox at the edge of newer Pineville Highway, just across the railroad tracks. gather any mail from the mailbox Grandfather had two goals when he told Aunt Ola he wanted to go the mail box to get the mail. He wanted to save her the trip to the mailbox, but he also wanted to stop near the railroad track to cut six foot tall Jimson grass for the young calf he was pampering, teaching it to eat grass rather than its mother’s milk. He picked up the mail, and stooped to cut Jimson Weed where the railroad crossed old Pineville road. Aunt Ola thought he would be safe enough since the morning train had already passed. However, World War II was in full swing, and not far from Aunt Ola’s house there was a new and “secret” plant making essential war products. The trains that carried the products away did not blow a whistle to indicate a train was crossing a roadway in order to prevent sabotage of the materials manufactured at the “swar —for secret security of materials leaving that special plant--that is did special c Just within the railroad right-of-way was a large stand of Jimson grass Grandfather had discovered that the calf liked the really tall Jimson stalks of grass that grew along the railroad track right-of-way where the track crossed Old Pineville Road. Grandfather Joe Parks had lived most of his life on a farm, away from highways, and so Aunt Ola was careful not to let him go into any area that was unsafe for him. The road in front of their house seldom had traffic on it, and the afternoon train had already passed on the railroad tracks that had to be crossed to reach the mailbox. <strong>*</strong>My parents thought of Pineville Road as the “new” road after it was paved. , When the highway was quite deaf, and Aunt Ola was careful there was a lar He failed to hear an approaching train because World War II was in full swing, and military trains did not blow at level crossings during the war to prevent attacks on trains carrying war materials or soldiers. The secret plant was known locally as “the shell plant” and no one who didn’t work there ever knew what it manufactured. Trains left that plant and mostly traveled toward South Carolina with its packed cars, and may have gone to the coast to be taken overseas. For security the trains from that plant never blew their whistles or horns at the level crossing where the “Old” section of Pineville Road intersected with the more modern Pineville Highway. </p><p>You may remember that when the road to Pineville was paved, and became “highway” for motored traffic, a little section of the road was </p><p>s profoundly deaf, liked to pick up the mail, and having worked from sunup to sundown all of his life, was eager to do his part on Uncle Vance’s farm. He wanted to walk down to the mailbox to get the morning mail, and since he did not have to cross the road itself to reach the mailbox, he delighted in completing this “chore” each day. Aunt Ola felt that she did not need to walk with him since the regular morning train had already passed. Therefore Grandfather set off on his own to pick up the mail from the box located on busy Pineville Road, . just beyond the level crossing. The mailbox was on the same side of the road when the expected and scheduled train had passed Aunt Ola agreed that he could pick up the mail. Before his return she heard a train, and it was stopping. The engineer of the war material train ha The and did not hear the train coming. He was buried beside his wife at Flint Hill Cemetery. Old Pink, the horse, spent the rest of his life in a wide pasture, near a lot of trees, with fine grass and a pond of water. </p><hr/><p>Now I want to continue this story—but Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance looked after her parents, and lived the rest of their lives on their farm , and thrived. And now I will tell you about a “coincidence” that occurred one Sunday evening when we were visiting Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance, some years after Grandmother and Grandfather died. The important part was that Louise and Fred were with us as we made the visit. Louise was in college at the time. Although there was no “extra” automobile in the driveway of my Aunt Ola’s home, we discovered that there was already an older gentleman I didn’t recognize sitting by their fire. He was their closest neighbor, and had lived just across the road from them for many long years, though I had never met him that I remembered My father had gone to school with him. His name was Audrey Bailes. He was dressed in overalls, as was my Uncle Vance. I </p><p>Now I will digress a little and explain that the road leading to Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance.s house had once been a part of the “Old Pineville Road”. When automobiles came into style and roads began to be paved, many roadways were changed, the better to accommodate automobiles. These changes affected Pineville Road. At some time, probably in the 1920’s or 1930’s the existing country road was “improved” and paved. During this effort the road’s right-of-way was slightly altered to avoid use of a very old wooden bridge that arched over the train track, and about a mile from that bridge the road re-crossed the same railroad at a level crossing. , probably in more than one location, but I knew about one of them that at least two locations between Charlotte and Pineville. The major reason for moving the bed of the highway was that part of its original path crossed the railroad twice within a little bit over one mile—and though one of the crossings was on a narrow wooden bridge, the other one was a level crossing. When Pineville road was paved for automobiles traffic and road traffic became more prevalent, there were designers who altered the path of the existing roadbed and decided to avoid both the decaying wooden bridge as well as the level crossing, and built the new road a few feet further away from the railroad track, thereby avoiding crossing the tracks at all. This reasonable improvement placed Uncle Vance’s farm and those of his neighbors on a rarely used stretch of “Old” Pineville Road, which was (during my childhood) a “half and half” road—paved on one side (for cars) and graveled on the other (for horses). </p><p>Now, back to my story. Uncle Vance and Aunt Ola lived near the level crossing of the railroad on Old Pineville Road, and as a child I visited them, along with my family, quite frequently. I played in the yard, and roamed around his saw mill, played in his huge pile of sawdust, or visited his chicken house, or his milk cow barn, or we went into the lower pasture by the pond where the cows grazed, along with the horses. There were woods beyond the pasture where wild grape vines grew and climbed trees making vines like the ones Tarzan could swing on. If the weather was unpleasant there was the attic where old furniture was stored, including a wind-up record player with records from the 1920’s. We always enjoyed our visits to Uncle Vance and Aunt Ola’s house</p><p>congregation. My Dad visited that church yard a many a Sunday evening in summer when he was young because he loved to listen to the singing. I seldom paid attention to the other houses or buildings along that road, though I knew Uncle Vance and Aunt Ola knew most of those people, but I had seldom met any of them. Then there came the evening when Bobby and I, along with Louise and Fred, stopped late one afternoon to see Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance and found that they already had a visitor, who was their neighbor, just across the road from them. His name was Audrey Bailes. Like my Uncle Vance, he was a farmer. A sad thing happened to him when he was a young father of two children. His wife left him and ran away with another man. Audrey had to raise his son and daughter by himself. I’m not sure where he lived while his children were growing up, but in his old age he lived right across the road from my Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance. He was a skinny, not overly tall man, and he often visited Uncle Vance, especially after his children married and moved away from Pineville. <strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong>*</strong>*</p><p>About the time I Paw-Paw and I started dating Paw-paw Audrey married again. Of course I saw him as a skinny, old, and not very interesting. He was a farmer, and I never saw him dressed in anything but overalls. He was about the same age as my parents, with grown-up children and lots of brothers and sisters and had gone to school with my Father. He had lots of kinfolk, but none who lived near-by. His wife had simply walked off one day years ago, and Audrey had finished raising his children by himself. My mother told me about his wife simply packing a sack with her belongings and walking out of the house to live with another man. Apparently she was not good at keeping house or being economical, because the day she left she had no shoes, and left barefooted. </p><p>During my childhood Audrey often visited Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance at the same time we did. My parents grew up in Pineville, and were acquainted with Audrey since their school days. Upon one visit when your Mother and Uncle Fred were with us, we learned that Audrey was getting married. I mentioned that to my mother-in-law (your mother called her Grammy) and to our surprise we discovered that Paw-paw’s father, Fred Oliver Beatty, whose mother was Harriet Beatty (Louise’s Great Grandmother) was the sister of Audrey Bailes. Louise was therefore kin to Audrey on Grandmother Beatty’s side of the family. </p><p>Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance welcomed Audrey’s new wife, and I think they “stood up” with them at their marriage. She was a pleasant little woman who worked in Charlotte at Belks Department Store. Within a year or so we learned that Audrey and his wife were expecting a child. I mentioned that fact to Paw-Paw who said, “You know, I have an Uncle Audrey Bailes who lives near Pineville.” So we asked our families, and sure enough, Bobby’s Great Uncle Audrey was the same person who lived across the road from my Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance Davis. There was a definite family connection.</p><p>I digress a little, and go back to my own childhood, close to twenty years later. It was a significant day in my grandparent’s lives, because it was the last Sunday they would depart from their own home to go to church, as they were moving the next week from their own home which had no running water (a well instead) or electricity, into an electrified house with my mother’s sister, Ola Davis, and her husband Vance. They were quite old, and unable to maintain their animals and fields. </p><p>They moved from their home to their daughter Ola’s house, on “Old Pineville Road”. You may remember traveling on the “new” Pineville Road that extended South Boulevard all the way to Pineville and beyond. There were at least two sections of the original road that because of homes and businesses along the original path of the road was extended to Pineville as a two-lane paved road which . Ola had no children, and was still living in the Pineville area, near their church and friends. Aunt Ola and Uncle Vance were very interesting people. Ola worked at the Shell Plant (a “hush,hush” place where whatever they made contributed to the “War efforts” during World War II.) I never did find out what they were making there. as it was During the next week they moved out of their home of perhaps forty or more years, one that Grandfather Parks built with my mother’s help (his sons were not at home) together, while my Grandmother rode in the car with my parents. I loved every minute of the ride behind the old horse, who’s name was Pink. It was a “milestone” in my grandfather’s life as well as in mine, because there was no need in his future for him to use the horse just to ride to church. They were moving in with my Aunt Ola Davis (my mother’s sister) and her husband Uncle Vance, and they had a fine four seat Ford Automobile. . </p><p>My grandparents’ new home was closer to Charlotte than their old home place, making it easier for us to visit. Also, the older folks had less to do—Uncle Vance did the field work, and the wood chopping, and Aunt Ola did the cooking and canning and looked after the milking and chicken feeding/egg collecting, and so forth. It made life much easier for Grandmother and Granddaddy, who would help only if they felt like it. It would be easier for Aunt Ola to look after her parents when they were living with her, instead of six or eight miles away. Aunt Ola had no children, and she and her husband Vance had extra rooms in their home to comfortably take them in. Several years later at my grandfather’s funeral there were still hitching posts in the church yard. Flint Hill Baptist Church eventually removed the hitching post, but only when there were no more members who came to Church in horse drawn vehicles. </p><p>Sadly, my Grandfather Parks was killed by an unscheduled military train soon after World War II began. There was a “sensitive” manufacturing plant between Pineville and Charlotte, which was “hidden” to some extent. The people who worked there didn’t talk about what was manufactured there, nor did they gossip about what they did while they were there. My father’s sister, Martha Yandle, as well as my Mother’s sister, Ola Davis, both worked at the plant as the war lengthened. The trains that arrived and/or left that plant never blew a whistle at level railroad crossings in fear of giving away regular schedules to anyone who wanted to sabotage military shipments. In places where truck, bus, and automobiles could safely cross the tracks people now had to really Stop, Look, and Listen carefully during World War II, because no hint was given that a train was coming—until those who wanted to cross the tracks could see or hear the wheels turning on the metal tracks. There were regular scheduled trains, but there were also military shipments that did not have a regular schedule. My Aunt told Granddaddy Parks he could cross the tracks to pick up the mail because the mid-morning train had already passed the crossing. On his way home Granddaddy paused beside the track to cut Jimson weed for his calf. He was profoundly deaf, and failed to either see or hear the approaching train. The train tried to stop, but it did not blow its whistle—and my Granddaddy Parks was struck by the train as he cut the tall Jimson grass for his calf. </p><p>I was far too young to even realize where the Parks home place was, but it was near the park where President ______ ‘s homeplace has been restored.<br/> p</p><h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2><p>I am now seventy-five years old.
